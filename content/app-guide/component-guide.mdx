import Callout from "../../src/components/Callout";

## Callout

The Callout component provides callouts to use it in any mdx file, to begin, first import the component.

```
import Callout from "{path from file}/src/components/Callout";
```

There are 7 different callout types: `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`, `bug`, `note`, `tip`. These are input for the Callout component's `type` prop, to render that type of callout. If no type is specificed the type `note` is set as default.

### Types

`success`

<Callout
  type="success"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

`warning`

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

`danger`

<Callout
  type="danger"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

`info`

<Callout
  type="info"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

`bug`

<Callout
  type="bug"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

`note`

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

`tip`

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. Binance Perpetual is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

The Callout component also takes a prop `body` which uses identifiers in the input body string to support bold and highlighting. Similar to regular markdown, You can use tags ` `` ` to surround text in the body input string to highlight, or you can use tags `##` to surround text in the body input string to bold.

### Example Bold

```
<Callout type="success" body="#Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33)#, trade it with your own risk. #Binance Perpetual# is different from futures contract, please see differences." />
```

<Callout
  type="success"
  body="#Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33)#, trade it with your own risk. #Binance Perpetual# is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

### Example Highlight

```
<Callout type="warning" body="`Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33)`, trade it with your own risk. `Binance Perpetual` is different from futures contract, please see differences."/>
```

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="`Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33)`, trade it with your own risk. `Binance Perpetual` is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

### Example Embedded links

The Callout component also supports nested links. Similar to regular markdown, You can use opening tag `[` and closing tag `]` to surround the text in the body input string to hyperlink it. When using links it is **required** to add a `link` prop that takes in an array of link strings, which are associated to your `[]` identifier's order.

```
<Callout type="warning" body="Currently [dydx], [terra], and [loopring] don't work on Binary Installers. It can only be used when running Hummingbot from source or with Docker." link={["/spot-connectors/dydx/","/protocol-connectors/terra","/spot-connectors/loopring/"]}/>
```

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="Currently [dydx], [terra], and [loopring] don't work on Binary Installers. It can only be used when running Hummingbot from source or with Docker."
  link={[
    "/spot-connectors/dydx/",
    "/protocol-connectors/terra",
    "/spot-connectors/loopring/",
  ]}
/>

If your inputs for identifier tags are not fully closed, or the number of links used don't match with the number of link tags used, then the component will render a message to tell you which prop to fix.

### Example Bullet Points

The Callout component also supports the above functionality in the form of bullet points. When applying bullet points, **instead of** using the `body` prop, use the `bullets` prop. The `bullets` prop takes in an array of strings with each string rendering into a bulletpoint. Bullet points support bold, highlight and links (mentioned above) and there is no limit to bulletpoint count.

Similar to using links in the `body` prop, when applying links in `bullets`, add your URL's into the `link` prop which takes an array of URL strings. To hyperlink the text in the `bullets` prop, surround it with `[` and `]`, The order of hyperlinks created by brackets applied in `bullets` corresponds with the order of the URL strings you put into the `link` prop. Please reference the example below.

```
<Callout
  type="note"
  bullets={[
    "this is bullet1 and I have a hummingbot miners [link].",
    "#this is bullet2 and I have no link but I'm bold.#",
    "`this is bullet3 and I am highlighted and have a` hummingbot docs [link].",
    "this is bullet4 testing dynamic bullet size",
    "this is bullet5 and I don't do anything"
  ]}
  link={["https://miner.hummingbot.io/", "https://docs.hummingbot.io/"]}
/>
```

<Callout
  type="note"
  bullets={[
    "this is bullet1 and I have a hummingbot miners [link].",
    "#this is bullet2 and I have no link but I'm bold.#",
    "`this is bullet3 and I am highlighted and have a` hummingbot docs [link].",
    "this is bullet4 testing dynamic bullet size",
    "this is bullet5 and I don't do anything",
  ]}
  link={["https://miner.hummingbot.io/", "https://docs.hummingbot.io/"]}
/>

### Example Body and Bullet Points

```
<Callout
  type="note"
  body="Make sure that you [activate] the Anaconda environment with `conda activate hummingbot` prior to running Hummingbot."
  bullets={[
    "This installation method is currently under testing and [awaiting] feedback from users. Should you run into problems or have found a fix to solve errors along the way, feel free to reach out through our [Discord] support channel.",
    "Added #version-0.36.0-arm_beta#, see release notes of [v0.36.0]",
  ]}
  link={["http://discord.hummingbot.io/", "/release-notes/0.36.0/"]}
/>
```

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="Make sure that you [activate] the Anaconda environment with `conda activate hummingbot` prior to running Hummingbot."
  bullets={[
    "This installation method is currently under testing and [awaiting] feedback from users. Should you run into problems or have found a fix to solve errors along the way, feel free to reach out through our [Discord] support channel.",
    "Added #version-0.36.0-arm_beta#, see release notes of [v0.36.0]",
  ]}
  link={["http://discord.hummingbot.io/", "/release-notes/0.36.0/"]}
/>

**Link Mismatch**

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="Currently [dydx], [terra], and [loopring] don't work on Binary Installers. It can only be used when running Hummingbot from source or with Docker."
  link={["/protocol-connectors/terra", "/spot-connectors/loopring/"]}
/>

**Identifier Mismatch**

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="`Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33), trade it with your own risk. `Binance Perpetual` is different from futures contract, please see differences."
/>

<Callout type="note" body="#Currently can't nest bold and highlight tags.#" />

**Math Equation**

```
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

$$
\{\underbrace{%
    \overbrace{a,\ldots, a}^{k\ a's},
    \overbrace{b,\ldots, b}^{l\ b's}}
  _{k+l\ \mathrm{elements}}        \}
$$
```

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

$$
\{\underbrace{%
    \overbrace{a,\ldots, a}^{k\ a's},
