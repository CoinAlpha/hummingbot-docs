## Start Hummingbot via Docker

Creating a new instance of Hummingbot with `docker run` will automatically start the Hummingbot client.

To run a previously created, stopped container where `$NAME` is the name of your instance of Hummingbot:

```sh
docker start $NAME && docker attach $NAME
```

### Start Hummingbot running in the background

Use the start script by running the command `./start.sh` to attach to a Hummingbot instance running in the background.

For additional information on useful commands, see the [commands](/operation/command-ref) to running Hummingbot on Docker.

## Start Hummingbot from Source

**Prerequisites:**

- Crypto Inventory: In order to run trading bot, you'll need some inventory of crypto assets available on the exchange, or in your Ethereum wallet (for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges).
  Remember that you need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). For example, if you are making a market in a `BTC/USDT` trading pair, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`.
  In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges. For more information, please see [Connectors](/exchange-connectors/overview/).
- API Keys: In order to run a bot on a centralized exchange like Binance, you will need to enter the exchange API keys during the Hummingbot configuration process.
  For more information on how to get the API keys for each exchange, please see the individual exchange pages in [Connectors](/exchange-connectors/overview/).
- Ethereum Wallet: In order to earn rewards from Liquidity Bounties, you need an Ethereum wallet. In addition, you'll need to import an Ethereum wallet when you run a trading bot on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.
  For more information on creating or importing an Ethereum wallet, see [Ethereum wallet](/operation/adv-command-ref/#setup-ethereum-wallet).
- Ethereum Node (DEX only): When you run a trading bot on a Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, your wallet sends signed transactions to the blockchain via an Ethereum node.
  For more information, see [Ethereum node](/operation/adv-command-ref/#setup-ethereum-nodes).

Open a Terminal window and go to the root of the directory that contains Hummingbot. From there, run:

```
bin/hummingbot.py
```

### Re-compiling

This section walks you through re-compiling Hummingbot after a code change.

```
# 1) Clean intermediate and compiled files from Cython compilation.
./clean

# 2) Install
./install

# 3) Deactivate old conda environment
conda deactivate

# 4) Activate conda environment
conda activate hummingbot

# 5) Compile
./compile

# 6) Run Hummingbot
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## Create a secure password

If you are using Hummingbot for the first time on this machine, the system will prompt you to create a password. This password will be used to encrypt sensitive configuration settings e.g. API keys, secret keys and wallet private keys.

## User Interface

![Hummingbot CLI](/img/hummingbot-cli.png)

The CLI is divided into five panes:

- **Input pane (lower left)**: Where users enter commands
- **Output pane (upper left)**: Prints the output of the user's commands
- **Log pane (right)**: Log messages
- **Top navigation bar**: Displays the status/information of the following items
  - Version:
  - paper_trade_mode:
  - Strategy:
  - Strategy_file:
- **Bottom navigation bar**: Displays the information of the following items
  - Trades
  - Total P&L
  - Return%
  - CPU
  - Mem
  - Threads
  - Duration

## Strategy-specific Files

The `create` command walks you through the process of initializing and configuring the global and strategy-specific settings necessary to run the bot. Running the command will create the following files in the `conf/` folder:

| File                                    | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conf_global.yml`                       | Global configuration settings, e.g. Binance API keys and Ethereum node.                              |
