2. You need the following to connect Hummingbot to the exchange:
   - API key. [Connect to Exchange Guide](/operation/connect-exchange).
   - API secret key
   - Passphrase
   - Account number (Always set value to **0** for now)
   - Stark private key

API credentials and a stark private key can be obtained programmatically using their documentation:

- [Recover Default API Credentials](https://docs.dydx.exchange/?python#recover-default-api-credentials)
- [Derive StarkKey](https://docs.dydx.exchange/?python#derive-starkkey)

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to get the required credentials:

1. From the dydx Perpetuals exchange, right-click anywhere on your web browser, and select **Inspect** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Application > Local Storage > https://trade.dydx.exchange
3. Select **STARK_KEY_PAIRS** and click the drop-down next to your wallet address to get the stark private key
4. Select **API_KEY_PAIRS** and click the drop-down next to your wallet address to get the API key, secret key, and passphrase

### Ethereum Wallet Address

You can use any Ethereum wallet address to connect to Hummingbot. If you're new to this and unsure which one to use, most of our users are on MetaMask.
