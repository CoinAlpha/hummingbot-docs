title: "Task 1 — Data Source & Order Book Tracker"
---

import Callout from "../../src/components/Callout";

The first 2 components to begin:

- `OrderBookTrackerDataSource`
- `OrderBookTracker`.

The `OrderBookTracker` contains subsidiary classes that help maintain the real-time order book of a market. Namely, the classes are `OrderBookTrackerDataSource` and `ActiveOrderTracker`.

## OrderBookTrackerDataSource

The `OrderBookTrackerDataSource` class is responsible for making API calls and/or WebSocket queries to obtain order book snapshots, order book deltas, and miscellaneous information on order book.

Integrating your own data source component requires you to extend from the `OrderBookTrackerDataSource` base class [here](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book_tracker_data_source.py).

The following details the **required** functions in `OrderBookTrackerDataSource`:

### `get_last_traded_prices`

Performs the necessary API request(s) to get last traded price for the given markets (trading_pairs) and return a dictionary of trading_pair and last traded price.

**Input Parameter:** trading_pairs: List[str]<br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[str, float]`

### `get_snapshot`

Fetches order book snapshot for a particular trading pair from the exchange REST API.<br/>

<Callout type="note" body=" Certain exchanges do not add a timestamp/nonce to the snapshot response. In this case, to maintain a real-time order book would require generating a timestamp for every order book snapshot and delta messages received and applying them accordingly. In #[Bittrex]#, this is performed by invoking the `queryExchangeState` topic on the SignalR WebSocket client." link={["https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector"]}/>

**Input Parameter:** client: `aiohttp.ClientSession`, trading_pair: `str` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[str, any]`

### `get_new_order_book`

Create a new order book instance and populate its `bids` and `asks` by applying the order_book snapshot to the order book, you might need to involve `ActiveOrderTracker` below.

**Input Parameter:** trading_pair: `str` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `OrderBook`

### `listen_for_trades`

Subscribes to the trade channel of the exchange. Adds incoming messages(of filled orders) to the `output` queue, to be processed by `OrderBookTracker` (in `_emit_trade_event_loop`)

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `listen_for_order_book_diffs`

Fetches or Subscribes to the order book snapshots for each trading pair. Additionally, parses the incoming message into a `OrderBookMessage` and appends it into the `output` Queue.

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `listen_for_order_book_snapshots`

Fetches or Subscribes to the order book deltas(diffs) for each trading pair. Additionally, parses the incoming message into a `OrderBookMessage` and appends it into the `output` Queue. |

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

## ActiveOrderTracker

The `ActiveOrderTracker` class is responsible for parsing raw data responses from the exchanges API servers.<br/> This is **not** required on all exchange connectors depending on API responses from the exchanges. This class is mainly used by DEXes to facilitate the tracking of orders

The table below details the **required** functions in `ActiveOrderTracker`:

### `active_asks`

Get all asks on the order book in dictionary format. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[Decimal, Dict[str, Dict[str, any]]]`

### `active_bids`

Get all bids on the order book in dictionary format. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[Decimal, Dict[str, Dict[str, any]]]`

### `convert_snapshot_message_to_order_book_row`

Convert an incoming snapshot message to Tuple of `np.arrays`, and then convert to `OrderBookRow`. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** `object`: message <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Tuple[List[OrderBookRow],List[OrderBookRow]]`

### `convert_diff_message_to_order_book_row`

Convert an incoming diff message to Tuple of `np.arrays`, and then convert to `OrderBookRow`. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** `object`: message <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Tuple[List[OrderBookRow],List[OrderBookRow]]`

### `convert_trade_message_to_order_book_row`

Convert an incoming trade message to Tuple of `np.arrays`, and then convert to `OrderBookRow`. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** `object`: message <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Tuple[List[OrderBookRow],List[OrderBookRow]]`

### `c_convert_snapshot_message_to_np_arrays`

Parses an incoming snapshot messages into `numpy.array` data type to be used by `convert_snapshot_message_to_order_book_row()`. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** `object`: message <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Tuple[numpy.array, numpy.array]`

### `c_convert_diff_message_to_np_arrays`

Parses an incoming delta("diff") messages into `numpy.array` data type to be used by `convert_diff_message_to_order_book_row()`. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** `object`: message <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Tuple[numpy.array, numpy.array]`

### `c_convert_trade_message_to_np_arrays`

Parses an incoming trade messages into `numpy.array` data type to be used by `convert_diff_message_to_order_book_row()`. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** `object`: message <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `numpy.array`

<Callout type="warning" body="`OrderBookRow` should only be used in the `ActiveOrderTracker` class, while `ClientOrderBookRow` should only be used in the `Market` class. This is due to improve performance especially since calculations in `float` fair better than that of `Decimal`."/>

## OrderBookTracker

The `OrderBookTracker` class is responsible for maintaining a real-time order book on the Hummingbot client. By using the subsidiary classes like `OrderBookTrackerDataSource` and `ActiveOrderTracker`(as required), it applies the market snapshot/delta messages onto the order book.

Integrating your own tracker would require you to extend from the `OrderBookTracker` base class [here](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book_tracker.py).

The following details the **required** functions to be implemented in `OrderBookTracker`:

### `exchange_name`

Returns the exchange name. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `str`

### `_order_book_diff_router`

Route the real-time order book diff messages to the correct order book.<br/><br/>Each trading pair has their own `_saved_message_queues`, this would subsequently be used by `_track_single_book` to apply the messages onto the respective order book. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `_order_book_snapshot_router`

Route the real-time order book snapshot messages to the correct order book.<br/><br/>Each trading pair has their own `_saved_message_queues`, this would subsequently be used by `_track_single_book` to apply the messages onto the respective order book. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `_track_single_book`

Update an order book with changes from the latest batch of received messages.<br/>Constantly attempts to retrieve the next available message from `_save_message_queues` and applying the message onto the respective order book.<br/>

> **Note:** Might require `convert_[snapshot/diff]_message_to_order_book_row` from the `ActiveOrderTracker` to convert the messages into `OrderBookRow`

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `start`

Start all custom listeners and tasks in the `OrderBookTracker` component.<br/>

<Callout type="note" body="You may be required to call `start` in the base class by using `await super().start()`. This is #optional# as long as there is a task listening for trade messages and emitting the `TradeEvent` as seen in `c_apply_trade` in [OrderBook]" link={["https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book.pyx"]}/>

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

## Debugging & Testing

As part of the QA process, for each tasks(Task 1 through 3) you are **required** to include the unit test cases for the code review process to begin. Refer to [Option 1: Unit Test Cases](/developer/debug&test/#option-1-unit-test-cases) to build your unit tests.
