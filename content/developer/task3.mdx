The **_Class Diagram_**, given above, details the critical variables and functions in the `Exchange` class.

The primary bulk of implementing a new exchange connector is in this task.

The role of the `Exchange` class can be broken down simply into placing,cancelling and tracking orders.
Although this might seem pretty straightforward, it does require a certain level of understanding and knowing the expected side-effect(s) of certain functions.

`Exchange` classes place orders via the `_create_order()` method, which require the following arguments:

| Arguments(s)   | Type        | Description                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `order_id`     | `str`       | ID used to track an order in Hummingbot.                                                  |
| `trading_pair` | `str`       | Name of the trading pair symbol(in Hummingbot's format i.e. `BASE-QUOTE`)                 |
| `price`        | `Decimal`   | Price in which the order will be placed in `Decimal`                                      |
| `amount`       | `Decimal`   | Amount in which the order will be placed in `Decimal`                                     |
| `order_type`   | `OrderType` | Specifies the order type of the order(i.e. `OrderType.LIMIT` and `OrderType.LIMIT_MAKER`) |
| `trade_type`   | `TradeType` | Specifies the trade type of the order(i.e. `TradeType.BUY` and `TradeType.SELL`)          |

<Callout

    "https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/event/events.py#L61-L69",
  ]}
/>

The `execute_buy` and `execute_sell` methods verify that the trades would be legal given the trading rules pulled from the exchange and calculate applicable trading fees. They then must do the following:

- Quantize the order amount to ensure that the precision is as required by the exchange
- Create a `params` dictionary with the necessary parameters for the desired order
- Pass the `params` to an `Auth` object to generate the signature and place the order
- Pass the resulting order ID and status along with the details of the order to an `InFlightOrder`

`InFlightOrders` are stored within a list in the `Market` class, and are Hummingbot’s internal records of orders it has placed that remain open on the market. When such orders are either filled or canceled, they are removed from the list and the relevant event completion flag is passed to the strategy module.

## Authentication

Placing and tracking of orders on the exchange normally requiring a form of authentication tied to every requests to ensure protected access/actions to the assets that users have on the respective exchanges.

As such, it would only make sense to have a module dedicated to handling authentication.

As briefly mentioned, the `Auth` class is responsible for creating the request parameters and/or data bodies necessary to authenticate an API request.

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="Mainly used in the `Market` class, but may be required in the `UserStreamTrackerDataSource` to authenticate subscribing to a WebSocket connection in [listen_for_user_stream]."
  link={["/developer/task2/#userstreamtrackerdatasource"]}
/>

### `generate_auth_dict`

Generates the url and the valid signature to authenticate a particular API request. <br/>

**Input Parameter:** http_method: `str`,url: `str`,params: `Dict[str, any]`,body: `Dict[str, any]` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[str, any]`

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="The #input parameters# and #return# value(s) can be modified accordingly to suit the exchange connectors. In most cases, the above parameters are required when creating a signature."
/>

## Market

The following describes in detail what is required for the `Market` class to place and track orders.

** Placing Orders **

`execute_buy` and `execute_sell` are the crucial functions when placing orders on the exchange,. The following describes the task of these functions.

### `execute_buy`

Function that takes the strategy inputs, auto corrects itself with trading rules, and places a buy order by calling the `place_order` function.<br/><br/>This function also begins to track the order by calling the `c_start_tracking_order` and `c_trigger_event` function.<br/> <br/>

**Input Parameter:** <br/> order_id: `str`,<br/>symbol: `str`,<br/>amount: `Decimal`,<br/>order_type: `OrderType`,<br/>price: `Optional[Decimal] = s_decimal_0` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `execute_sell`

Function that takes the strategy inputs, auto corrects itself with trading rules, and places a sell order by calling the `place_order` function.

**Input Parameter:** <br/> order_id: `str`,<br/>symbol: `str`,<br/>amount: `Decimal`,<br/>order_type: `OrderType`,<br/>price: `Optional[Decimal] = s_decimal_0` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="The `execute_buy` and `execute_sell` methods verify that the trades would be allowed given the trading rules obtained from the exchange and calculate applicable trading fees. They then must do the following,"
/>

- Quantize the order amount to ensure that the precision is as required by the exchange
- Create a `params` dictionary with the necessary parameters for the desired order
- Pass the `params` to an `Auth` object to generate the signature and place the order
- Pass the resulting order ID and status along with the details of the order to an `InFlightOrder`
- `InFlightOrders` are stored within a list in the `Market` class, and are Hummingbot’s internal records of orders it has placed that remain open on the market. When such orders are either filled or canceled, they are removed from the list and the relevant event completion flag is passed to the strategy module.

Considering that placing of orders normally involves a `POST` request to a particular buy/sell order REST API endpoint. This would **require** additional parameters like :

| Variable(s)  | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

** Cancelling Orders **

The `execute_cancel` function is the primary function used to cancel any particular tracked order. Below is a quick overview of the `execute_cancel` function

### `execute_cancel`

Function that makes API request to cancel an active order and returns the `order_id` if it has been successfully cancelled or no longer needs to be tracked.<br/>

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="This function also stops tracking the order by calling the `c_stop_tracking_order` and `c_trigger_event` functions."
/>{" "}

**Input Parameter:**<br/> symbol: `str`,<br/>order_id: `str` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** order_id: `str`

** Tracking Orders & Balances **

The `Market` class tracks orders in several ways:

- Listening on user stream<br/>
  This is primarily done in the `_user_stream_event_listener` function. This is only done when the exchange has a WebSocket API.

- Periodic status polling<br/>
  This serves as a fallback for when user stream messages are not caught by the `UserStreamTracker`. This is done by the `_status_polling_loop`

The table below details the **required** functions to implement

| Function<div style="width:150px"/> | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_user_stream_event_listener`      | Update order statuses and/or account balances from incoming messages from the user stream.                            |
| `_update_balances`                 | Pulls the REST API for the latest account balances and updates `_account_balances` and `_account_available_balances`. |
| `_update_order_status`             | Pulls the REST API for the latest order statuses and updates the order statuses of locally tracked orders.            |

If the exchange doesn't provide user balance updates in real-time (web socket), you will need to set `self._real_time_balance_update = False` in the market constructor (init).

And, you will need to take `in_flight_orders` snapshot during `_update_balances` as below:

```python
    self._in_flight_orders_snapshot = {k: copy.copy(v) for k, v in self._in_flight_orders.items()}
    self._in_flight_orders_snapshot_timestamp = self._current_timestamp
```

This is so that the connector can use default current balance calculation (in `market_base`) for available balances.

> **Tip:**
> Refer to [Order Lifecycle](/developer/tutorial/#order-lifecycle-and-market-events) for a more detailed description on how orders are being tracked in Hummingbot.

It is necessary that the above functions adhere to the flow as defined in the order lifecycle for the connector to work as intended.

** Trading Rules **

Trading Rules are defined by the respective exchanges. It is crucial that Hummingbot manage and maintain the set of trading rules to ensure that there will be no issues when placing orders.

A list of some common rules can be seen in [`trading_rule.pyx`](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/trading_rule.pyx).

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="Most exchanges have a minimum trading size. Not all rules need to be defined, however, it is essential to meet the rules as specified by the exchange."
/>

All trading rules are stored in `self._trading_rules` in the `Market` class.

The following details the functions responsible for maintaining the `TradeRule` for each trading pair

### `_trading_rules_polling_loop`

A background process that periodically polls for trading rule changes. Since trading rules tend not to change as often as account balances and order statuses, this is done less often. This function is responsible for calling `_update_trading_rules`

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `_update_trading_rules`

Gets the necessary trading rules definitions form the corresponding REST API endpoints. Calls `_format_trading_rules`; that parses and updates the `_trading_rules` variable in the `Market` class.

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `_format_trading_rules`

Parses the raw JSON response into a list of [`TradingRule`](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/trading_rule.pyx).

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="This is important since exchanges might only accept certain precisions and impose a minimum trade size on the order."
/>

**Input Parameter:** `List[Any]` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `List[TradingRule]`

** Order Price/Size Quantum & Quantize Order Amount **

This, together with the trading rules, ensure that all orders placed by Hummingbot meet the required specifications as defined by the exchange.

- These checks are performed in `execute_buy` and `execute_sell` **before** placing an order.
- In the event where the orders proposed by the strategies fail to meet the requirements as defined in the trading rules, the intended behaviour for the `Market` class is simply to raise an error and not place the order.<br/>
- You may be required to add additional functions to help determine if an order meets the necessary requirements.

The following details some functions responsible for this.

### `c_get_order_price_quantum`

Gets the minimum increment interval for an order price.

**Input Parameter:** `str trading_pair`,`object price`

### `c_quantize_order_amount`

Checks the current order amount against the trading rules, and corrects(i.e simple rounding) any rule violations. Returns a valid order amount in `Decimal` format.

**Input Parameter:** <br/>`str trading_pair`,`object amount`,<br/>`object price=s_decimal_0` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Decimal`

### `c_quantize_order_price`
