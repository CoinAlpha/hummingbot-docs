## About Bitfinex

Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange owned and operated by iFinex Inc., which is headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands.

Bitfinex was founded in December 2012 as a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, offering digital asset trading services to users around the world. Bitfinex initially started as a P2P margin lending platform for Bitcoin and later added support for more cryptocurrencies.

## Using the Connector

To use Bitfinex connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Bitfinex key >>>
Enter your Bitfinex secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only.
At no point will private or API keys be shared to someone or be used in any way other
than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

Make sure you give permissions to **Read** and **Write** and enter your 2FA code.

Confirm your API-key request by pass on the link in the email letter. You will receive a notification: _Almost Done! Please check your email to complete the creation of this new API key._

<Callout type="warning" body="For API key permissions, we recommend using #Orders# enabled API keys; enabling #withdraw#, or the equivalent is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies."/>

Once you pass the link in an email letter, you've created a new API Key!

Your API Secret will be displayed on the screen. Make sure you store your API Secret somewhere secure, and do not share it with anyone.

The API key and API secret key is required for using Hummingbot.

<Callout type="warning" body="If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API."/>
