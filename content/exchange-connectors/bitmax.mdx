## Using the Connector

To use [Bitmax](https://bitmax.io/en/global-digital-asset-platform) connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Bitmax API key >>>
Enter your Bitmax secret API key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

### Creating Bitmax API Keys

1. Log in to your account at https://bitmax.io/en/global-digital-asset-platform, then click your profile > API settings (If you do not have an account, you will have to create one and verify your ID.)

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="You must enable 2FA in your Bitmax account to create the API key. [How to enable 2FA]?"

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body=" For API key permissions, we recommend using `trade` and `view` enabled API keys; enabling `transfer,` `or the equivalent is unnecessary `for current Hummingbot strategies."
/>

3. Now you have created an API key, connect it to Hummingbot by using the `connect` command.

Make sure you store your Secret Key somewhere secure and do not share it with anyone. Your Secret Key will only be displayed once at the time when you create the API.

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API."
