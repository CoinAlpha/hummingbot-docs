## Using the Connector

To use [CoinZoom](https://www.coinzoom.com) connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your CoinZoom API key >>>
Enter your CoinZoom secret API key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.
