## Using the connector

Because dYdX perpetual is a decentralized exchange, you will need to create API keys, stark keys and ethereum wallet. See below for information on how to create these:

Here's the [link](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/5108497-how-to-deposit-usdc-or-any-erc-20-token-into-your-l2-perpetual-account?utm_content=article_5108497) on how to signup and deposit on dYdX perpetual.

```
Enter your dydx Perpetual API key >>>
Enter your dydx Perpetual API secret >>>
Enter your dydx Perpetual passphrase >>>
Enter your dydx Perpetual API account_number >>>
Enter your stark private key >>>
Enter your ethereum wallet address >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.
