ETERBASE is the first regulation-compliant European cryptocurrency exchange, offering fast, secure trading on a clean, powerful, user interface.

## Using the Connector

Eterbase is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Eterbase API key >>>
Enter your Eterbase secret key >>>
Enter your Eterbase Account >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

<Callout type="tip" body="For copying and pasting into Hummingbot, see [this page] for more instructions in our Support section." link={["https://hummingbot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004871203-Copy-and-paste-your-API-keys"]} />

Make sure you store your Secret Key somewhere secure, and do not share it with anyone. Your Secret Key will only be displayed once at the time when you create the API.

<Callout type="tip" body="If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API." />
