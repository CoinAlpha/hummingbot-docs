KuCoin is a centralized exchange based in Hong Kong that opened for cryptocurrency trading in September 2017. Nicknamed the "People's Exchange"​, Kucoin is claimed to be easy to use for novice investors while being in-depth enough for crypto enthusiasts.

KuCoin claims to have one of the world’s most impressive trading pair selections, a wide range of alt coins with more than 300 trading pairs, and is regularly adding new pairs. The exchange also has its own cryptocurrency, [KuCoin Tokens (KCS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kucoin-token/).

## Using the Connector

Because [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API keys in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your KuCoin API key >>>
Enter your KuCoin secret key >>>
Enter your KuCoin passphrase >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.
