## Using the Connector

To use [ProBit](https://www.probit.kr/login?) connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your ProBit API key >>>
Enter your ProBit secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

### Creating ProBit API Keys

1. Log in to your account [here](https://www.probit.com/login?locale=en-us&url=/exclusive), then click your My Page > API Management (If you do not have an account, you will have to create one and enable 2FA.)

<Callout

  body="To use ProBit Korea, you will need to complete the Korea KYC verification process. Generally this requires you to be a Korean resident"
/>

3. Now you have created an API key, connect it to Hummingbot by using the `connect` command.

Make sure you store your Secret Key somewhere secure and do not share it with anyone. Your Secret Key will only be displayed once at the time when you create the API.

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API."
