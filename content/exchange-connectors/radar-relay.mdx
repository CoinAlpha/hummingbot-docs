description: About Radar Relay Connector
---

[Radar Relay](https://radarrelay.com/) is an exchange application specializing in ERC-20 tokens that uses the [0x Protocol](https://0x.org/). Founded in 2017, it is a newer exchange that has rapidly gained users and features continuous trading with its off-chain order book.

## Using the Connector

Because Radar Relay is a decentralized exchange, you will need an independent cryptocurrency wallet and an ethereum node in order to use Hummingbot. See below for information on how to create these:

### Transaction Fees

Presently, Radar Relay does [not charge](https://support.radarrelay.com/en/support/solutions/articles/42000022033-what-are-your-fees-) trading or withdrawal fees, and the only additional cost for transactions is the gas network costs. This may change in the future as the exchange develops a larger user base.
