title: Balance Limit

**Updated on version [0.35.0](/release-notes/0.35.0)**

Sets the amount limit on how much assets Hummingbot can use in an exchange or wallet. This can be useful when running multiple bots on different trading pairs with same tokens e.g. running a BTC-USDT pair and another bot on ETH-USDT using the same account.

## How It Works

You can set how much of a particular token the bot can use by running the command `balance limit [exchange] [asset] [amount]`. You can disable this feature by editing it in the global config file and set it to -1. While setting it to 0 will initially not place any order for a specific asset until a trade is executed to accumulate the said asset.

For example:

```
>>>  balance limit binance USDT 100
Limit for USDT on binance exchange set to 100.0
```

Run the `balance` command again or `balance limit` to confirm the limit has been applied.

```
>>>  balance

       XRP    0.8440         -

## Example Scenario

Create pure market making strategy, run `config` to view the whole configuration.

![config](img/config1.png)

Run `balance limit binance ETH 0.0513` to set the balance limit to 0.0513 ETH. Run `balance limit binance USDT 30` to set the balance limit to 30 USDT. Both ETH and USDT value is equivalent to \$30.

![run balance](img/run_balance.png)

Each order is 0.0188 equivalent to \$11.20

![order amount](img/order_amount.png)

Sell order gets filled. USDT available balance is now 30.1657

![sell filled](img/sell_filled.png)

Another sell order gets filled, the available balance now shows 41.2069. Plus the open buy order, the "usable" balance on USDT is now at around \$52.

![sell filled2](img/sell_filled2.png)

After the two sell orders gets filled the remaining available balance in ETH is 0.0137 equivalent to $8.17. It means that after the next `order_refresh_time` it won't create sell order because the minimum order amount is $11.

![buy order](img/buy_order.png)

![buy order1](img/buy_order1.png)

Same process as the scenario above. After the two buy orders gets filled the remaining available balance in USDT is 7.5317 equivalent to $7.53. It means that after the next `order_refresh_time` it won't create buy order because the minimum order amount is $11.
