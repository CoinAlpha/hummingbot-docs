## The Debug Console

The debug console is a powerful tool for Hummingbot developers to inspect and modify the live states in Hummingbot while it's running. It gives access to a live Python console living in the same process as Hummingbot. It can be thought of as similar to the developer console found in most modern browsers.

### Activating the Debug Console

The debug console is disabled by default. You need to enable it by setting `debug_console: true` in `conf/conf_global.yml`.

### Entering the Debug Console

When you start Hummingbot with debug console enabled, it will print out a "Started debug console" log message at start.

<Callout type="note" body="The port number printed in the debug message (port 8211 in the example above), you can use `telnet` or `nc` to access the debug console by connecting to the TCP port described in the log message." />

### Accessing Python Modules and Exposed Objects

Once you've entered the debug console, you have access to a fully featured Python interpreter living in the Hummingbot process.

You can access all the exposed properties under the `HummingbotApplication` class via the `hb` object.

Here are some of the exposed properties you can access from the debug console:

- `hb.strategy`: The currently active strategy object
- `hb.markets`: A dictionary of active market connectors
- `hb.acct`: The currently active Ethereum wallet object
- `hb.clock`: The clock object that's driving all the Hummingbot components

### Sample Ways to Use the Console

Below is an example where a developer queries the currently active bids/asks under the strategy, and the current best ask price on Binance.

You should refer to the source code of the exposed objects to see what properties you can inspect and modify inside the debug console.

## Developer Notes

- Additional details of the scripts can be found on [Github: Hummingbot Install Scripts](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/development/installation/install-from-source).
- The installation instructions above use [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a lighter version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) which is sufficient to run Hummingbot. To learn more about the differences and what works best for you, see [this post](http://deeplearning.lipingyang.org/2018/12/23/anaconda-vs-miniconda-vs-virtualenv/).
