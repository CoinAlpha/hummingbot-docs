title: Kill Switch
description:
---

Automatically stops the bot when it reaches a certain performance threshold, which can be either positive or negative. This feature uses the same performance calculation methodology as the [history](/operation/performance-history/) command.

```
Would you like to enable the kill switch? (Yes/No) >>>
At what profit/loss rate would you like the bot to stop? (e.g. -5 equals 5 percent loss) >>>
```

You can always reconfigure this feature in two ways:

1. Inside Hummingbot run command `config kill_switch_enabled` and/or `config kill_switch_rate`.
2. Edit `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor.

Note that when the market prices changes, so does the bot's performance and may trigger the kill switch. For example, we executed 13 trades and our performance are shown below.

```json
- kill_switch_enabled: True
- kill_switch_rate: -0.3
```

After a while, the end price changed from 202.715 to 200.54 and so did our bot's performance even without making more trades. Since `kill_switch_rate` is set to `-0.3` this will stop the strategy.
