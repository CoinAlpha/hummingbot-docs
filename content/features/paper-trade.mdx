This feature allows users to test Hummingbot and simulate trading strategies without risking any actual assets. Enter the command `paper_trade` to enable this feature.

## Enabling and Disabling

Paper trading mode can be enabled and disabled from the Hummingbot client by doing `paper_trade` or `config paper_trade_enabled`.

The top bar shows the status to indicate if paper trading mode is on or off.

It also shows a reminder that paper trade was enabled when doing a `status` or `history` command.

  body="In the event that the bot is running on paper trade and you disable it, you need to `stop` and `start` the bot to apply the changes. Make sure your Exchange APIs are connected as well when going live."

## Adding Paper Trade Balance

By default, the paper trade account has the following tokens and balances, which you can see when you run the `balance paper` command.

```
>>>  balance paper
Paper account balances:
    Asset    Balance
      DAI  1000.0000
      ETH    10.0000
      ONE  1000.0000
     TUSD  1000.0000
     USDC  1000.0000
     USDQ  1000.0000
     USDT  1000.0000
     WETH    10.0000
      ZRX  1000.0000
```

When adding balances, specify the asset and balance you want by running this command `balance paper [asset] [amount]`.

For example, we want to add 0.5 BTC and check our paper account balance to confirm.

```
>>>  balance paper BTC 0.5
Paper balance for BTC token set to 0.5

>>>  balance paper
Paper account balances:
    Asset    Balance
      BTC     0.5000
      DAI  1000.0000
      ETH    10.0000
      ONE  1000.0000
     TUSD  1000.0000
     USDC  1000.0000
     USDQ  1000.0000
     USDT  1000.0000
     WETH    10.0000
      ZRX  1000.0000
```
