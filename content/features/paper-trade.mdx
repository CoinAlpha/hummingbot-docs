## Enabling and Disabling

Paper trading mode can be enabled and disabled from the Hummingbot client by doing `paper_trade` or `config paper_trade_enabled`.

The top bar shows the status to indicate if paper trading mode is on or off.

## Adding Paper Trade Balance

By default, the paper trade account has the following tokens and balances which you can see when you run the `balance paper` command.

```
>>>  balance paper
Paper account balances:
    Asset    Balance
      DAI  1000.0000
      ETH    10.0000
      ONE  1000.0000
     TUSD  1000.0000
     USDC  1000.0000
     USDQ  1000.0000
     USDT  1000.0000
     WETH    10.0000
      ZRX  1000.0000
```

When adding balances, specify the asset and balance you want by runing this command `balance paper [asset] [amount]`.

For example, we want to add 0.5 BTC and check our paper account balance to confirm.

```
>>>  balance paper BTC 0.5
Paper balance for BTC token set to 0.5

>>>  balance paper
Paper account balances:
    Asset    Balance
      BTC     0.5000
      DAI  1000.0000
      ETH    10.0000
      ONE  1000.0000
     TUSD  1000.0000
     USDC  1000.0000
     USDQ  1000.0000
     USDT  1000.0000
     WETH    10.0000
      ZRX  1000.0000
```

A restart might be required in order to make any `balance paper` change to reflect the paper trade exchange inventory for `status` command.
