title: Rate Limits Share Pct
---

Some exchanges impose rate limits per account. When running multiple bots using a single account, `rate_limits_share_pct` users to set a certain percentage of the total limit to each instance. When the bot is near the allocated limit, Hummingbot sends a notification as a warning so users can adjust their configuration before the account is banned.

For example, the rate limit for AscendEX is 100 requests per second. Your account will be banned for a certain period of time if you keep hitting the rate limit in 10 minutes (status code `429` or `100014`).

Setting 50% for `rate_limits_share_pct` means we want the bot to send a notification when it starts to send 50 requests per second for that specific instance.

## How to use the parameter

1. Run `config rate_limits_share_pct` while the strategy is stopped
2. Enter the percentage of API rate limit you want to allocate to the bot

3. Start the strategy using `start` command
4. A notification will be displayed in the output pane when the `rate_limits_share_pct` value is about to be reached

!!! note
You can also configure this setting while the strategy is running. However, the strategy must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
