## How it works

For the rate oracle conversion to show after the `balance`, `pnl`, `open_orders`, `trades`, and `status` command, You have to edit in `config_global.yml` to change the `rate_oracle_source`, `global_token` and `global_token_symbol` or you can edit it by using the `config` command.

Refer to the example below:

Change the default setting in `conf_global.yml` to GBP (Great Britain Pound). The conversion will show up when you run `balance` command.
