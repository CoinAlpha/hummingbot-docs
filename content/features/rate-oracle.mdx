This new feature provides a real-time, most up-to-date exchange rate on any given token or currency from a reliable and trustworthy data source.

In version 0.40, rate oracle has been integrated with [AMM-Arbitrage Strategy](/strategies/amm-arb).

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="You can see how the rate oracle works with a strategy on [cross exhange market making] and [arbitrage] strategy."
  link={["/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/", "/strategies/arbitrage/"]}
/>

## `rate_oracle_source`

The source where you want to pull data from can either be Binance, Coingecko, KuCoin, or AscendEX. Please take note that using Coingecko will have a 30-second delay due to their API rate limit.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="What source do you want rate oracle to pull data from? (binance, coingecko, kucoin, ascend_ex)"
  response=">>> "
/>

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="Currently, USD (default) global token does not work with Kucoin and Ascendex, you may need to change your `global_token` to USDT."
  link={[]}
/>

## `global_token`

This is a token in which you can display other tokens' value. Set the `global_token` according to your preferred token value.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="What is your default display token? (e.g. USDT,USD,EUR)"
  response=">>> "
/>

## `global_token_symbol`

The symbol for the global token.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="What is your default display token symbol? (e.g. $, â‚¬)"
  response=">>> "
/>

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="If you happen to `start` the bot and produce the error, `Oracle rate is not available`, or If the `rate_oracle_source` fails to show any price reference on your pair, you may change the `oracle_source` by running `config rate_oracle_source` and switch between Binance or Coingecko."

## How it works

If you need to view the rate oracle conversion after the `balance`, `pnl`, `open_orders`, `trades`, and `status` command, set it manually in the **config_global.yml**.

To set the parameters for `rate_oracle_source`, `global_token` and `global_token_symbol`, run the `config` command.

Refer to the example below:

Change the default setting in **conf_global.yml** to GBP (Great Britain Pound). The conversion will show up when you run the `balance` command.

The conversion also shows up during the `status` command for the `liquidity_mining` strategy, under the `Miner` section.

The conversion shows up when using the `pnl` command.

The conversion also shows up when running the `trades` command.

The conversion also works with the `open_orders` command.
