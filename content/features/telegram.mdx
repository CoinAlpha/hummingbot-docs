## Setting up in Hummingbot

You can now startup Hummingbot and confirm that the integration is properly configured. To enable Telegram in Hummingbot do the following:

1. Run `config telegram_enabled` and set to True or answer Yes to enable the Telegram integration
2. Run `config telegram_token` and enter the Telegram token ID from BotFather
3. Run `config telegram_chat_id` and enter the chat ID from [Getting your Telegram ID](#getting-your-telegram-id)

## Using the Telegram Bot

Before you start Hummingbot, make sure that the Telegram bot is live. If so, you should see a chat pane with your bot's name in Telegram.
Start Hummingbot as you would normally. Telegram will be connected as soon as you run `start` in your hummingbot CLI window. Messages are synchronized in real-time between the Telegram bot and the actual Hummingbot instance running. For example, you can use commands such as `status` and `history` to monitor the bot's performance, `config` shows bot current configurations and you can use `start` and `stop` to control the bot.

> **Tip:** If you are running multiple bots with Telegram enabled, you can use the same Telegram chat ID with different API tokens from each bot you created to control all of them. You can also use their [chat folders](https://telegram.org/blog/folders) feature to organize your bots.
