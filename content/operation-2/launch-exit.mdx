This page contains information on launching and exiting the application, assuming Hummingbot is installed already on your machine.

## Launch via Docker

If you downloaded the helper script before, proceed to step 2.

1. Download `start.sh` helper script from Github using the command below.

```Manual
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/start.sh
chmod a+x start.sh
```

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="Run #`ls`# command from the terminal to check if the file is in your current directory."
/>

2. Run the following command inside the directory where the helper script is located:

```Manual
./start.sh
```

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="If no containers are running, follow the guide to creating a Hummingbot instance."
/>

## Launch from source

1. Make sure the hummingbot conda environment is enabled.

```Manual
conda activate hummingbot
```

2. In the `hummingbot` parent directory, run this command to launch the application:

```Manual
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## Exit Hummingbot

Running the `exit` command cancels all outstanding orders and exit the Hummingbot interface. In case of errors, the command `exit -f` will force the application to close.

If you're running Hummingbot installed via binary, exiting Hummingbot by clicking the close window icon will leave your active orders open in the exchange.

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="You can also press the keyboard shortcut #`CTRL + C`# twice to exit."
/>
