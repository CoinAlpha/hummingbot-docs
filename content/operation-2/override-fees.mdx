title: Override Fees

import Callout from "../../src/components/Callout";

By default, Hummingbot uses the default fees of the exchange. However, if you're on a VIP level getting discounts on fees, you can override this by editing the `conf_fee_overrides.yml` inside the `conf` or `hummingbot_conf` directory, depending on your installation method.

  body="Exit and restart Hummingbot for the changes to take effect."
