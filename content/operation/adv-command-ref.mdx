## Running Multiple Bots

### Multiple bots via Docker

Create multiple instances using `./create.sh` script. More information can be found in [Hummingbot Docker Scripts](/operation/commands/#docker-scripts). Below commands download the create script and make it executable.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```Linux
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
```

```MacOS
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create.sh -o create.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
```

```Windows via Docker Toolbox
cd ~
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create.sh -o create.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### Running in the background (via Docker)

Press keys `Ctrl+P` then `Ctrl+Q` in sequence to detach from Docker i.e. return to command line. This exits out of Hummingbot without shutting down the container instance.

Restart or connect to a running instance using `./start.sh` script. Below commands download the start script and make it executable.


<MultiCodeBlock>

```Linux
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/start.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
```

```MacOS
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/start.sh -o start.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
```

```Windows via Docker Toolbox
cd ~
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/start.sh -o start.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
```
</MultiCodeBlock>


### Multiple bots from source

> Tip: We recommend that users download and install Hummingbot separately for each instance they wish to run.

Below command downloads the Hummingbot repository from GitHub where `$FOLDER_NAME` is the name of the separate directory.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot.git $FOLDER_NAME
```

Do another install in the new directory.

```
cd $FOLDER_NAME
./install
conda activate hummingbot
./compile
```

### Running in the background (from source)

Use either `tmux` or `screen` to run multiple bots installed from source. Check out these external links how to use them.

* [Getting started with Tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/)
* [How to use Linux Screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/)

When using screen to run an instance in the background, run either of the following commands: `screen` or `screen -S $NAME`, where `$NAME` is what you wish to call this background instance. Use the latter to be more explicit if you want to run multiple bots.

Navigate to the folder where your separate Hummingbot is installed, then start the bot like normal.

```
conda activate hummingbot
bin/hummingbot.py
```

To exit the screen (detach), press `Ctrl+A` then `Ctrl+D` in sequence.

To list all running instances, use `screen -ls`.

![List Screen Instances](screen1.png)

Log back into the screen by using either `screen` or `screen -r $NAME` to open a specific instance.

## Kill Switch

Automatically stops the bot when it reaches a certain performance threshold, which can be either positive or negative. This feature uses the same performance calculation methodology as the [history](/operation/commands/history) command.

```
Would you like to enable the kill switch? (Yes/No) >>>
At what profit/loss rate would you like the bot to stop? (e.g. -5 equals 5 percent loss) >>>
```

You can always reconfigure this feature in two ways:

1. Inside Hummingbot run command `config kill_switch_enabled` and/or `config kill_switch_rate`.
1. Editing `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor.


Note that when the market prices changes, so does the bot's performance and may trigger the kill switch. For example, we executed 13 trades and our performance are shown below.

```json
- kill_switch_enabled: True
- kill_switch_rate: -0.3
```

```
Inventory:

Performance:

  Return %: -0.0985 %
```

After a while, the end price changed from 202.715 to 200.54 and so did our bot's performance even without making more trades. Since `kill_switch_rate` is set to `-0.3` this will stop the strategy.

## Fee override

This feature overrides trading fees (maker and taker) from corresponding market connector. This applies to users that has discounted rates or VIP account with specific fees.

### How to configure fee override?

Edit `conf_fee_overrides.yml` file using a text editor which is located in the `/conf` directory. Specific path or location may vary depending on the environment and how Hummingbot was installed.

- Installed from source: `hummingbot/conf`
- Installed via Docker: `hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf`
    - `hummingbot_files` is the default name of the parent directory. This can be different depending on the setup 
    when the instance was created.
- Installed via Binary (Windows): `%localappdata%\hummingbot.io\Hummingbot\conf`
- Installed via Binary (MacOS): `~/Library/Application\ Support/Hummingbot/Conf`

### Fee override configuration by default

```
* Exchange trading fees, the values are in precise decimal, e.g. 0.1 for 0.1%.
* If the value is left blank, the default value (from corresponding market connector) will be used.

binance_maker_fee:
binance_taker_fee:

coinbase_pro_maker_fee:
coinbase_pro_taker_fee:

huobi_maker_fee:
huobi_taker_fee:

liquid_maker_fee:
liquid_taker_fee:

bittrex_maker_fee:
bittrex_taker_fee:

kucoin_maker_fee:
kucoin_taker_fee:

kraken_maker_fee:
kraken_taker_fee:
```

> Note: Make sure Hummingbot is not running on background or exit Hummingbot first before editing `conf/conf_fee_overrides.yml`.


## Logs and Logging

As Hummingbot is an in-progress, open-access software, logs are available locally for each time an instance is run. Logs contain records of what happens when a bot is run, including the results of specified checks and behaviors as well as error tracing.

### Viewing Log Configurations

The way that log files are structured is contained within `conf/hummingbot_logs.yml`. For now, we request that users leave the log settings at the defaults. This makes it easier for the Hummingbot team to trace bugs and other problems that users face when logs are submitted.

### Error Log Collection

The only data Hummingbot requests from users is error logs. We collect error logs for the sole purpose of debugging and continuously improving Hummingbot. We'll never share the data with a third party.

You can choose to disable error logging.

```
Would you like to send error logs to hummingbot? (Yes/No) >>>
```
If the user answers "No", then no data will be collected.

You can always enable/disable sending error logs in two ways:

1. Editing `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor.
1. Inside Hummingbot enter: `config send_error_logs`.

### Viewing Individual Log Files

For users who wish to locate and submit log files, generally they are located in the `/logs` folder. 
Specific path or location may vary depending on the environment and how Hummingbot was installed.

- Installed from source: `hummingbot/logs`
- Installed via Docker: `hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs`
    - `hummingbot_files` is the default name of the parent directory. This can be different depending on the setup 
    when the instance was created.
- Installed via Binary (Windows): `%localappdata%\hummingbot.io\Hummingbot\logs`
- Installed via Binary (MacOS): `~/Library/Application\ Support/Hummingbot/Logs`

### Log File Management

A separate log file will now be generated daily. When a new log file is created, if there are more than 7 files, 
the oldest ones will be deleted in order to limit disk storage usage. 
The log rotation feature was added in [Hummingbot version 0.17.0](https://docs.hummingbot.io/release-notes/0.17.0/#log-file-management-data-storage).

If you are looking for support in handling errors or have questions about behavior reported in logs, 
you can find ways of contacting the team or community in our [support section](/support).


## Setup Ethereum wallet

### Why does Hummingbot need my Ethereum wallet private key?

Strategies that transact on decentralized exchanges (such as [Radar Relay](/connectors/radar-relay), [Bamboo Relay](/connectors/bamboo-relay), and [Dolomite](/connectors/dolomite)) directly interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, transactions must be signed and authorized, which requires your private key.

Run command `connect ethereum` to connect your Ethereum wallet with Hummingbot.

```
Enter your wallet private key >>>
```

### Importing your wallet

There are two ways to import your Hummingbot wallet from other wallets like Metamask and MyCrypto:

1. Importing the wallet's keyfile (recommended)
2. Importing the wallet's private key

We recommend using the keyfile method over copying and pasting the private key. If your private key remains in your clipboard, there is a risk that a malicious website that you visit may utilize Javascript to access your clipboard and copy its contents.

> Tip "Metamask wallet": Using a wallet that is available in your Metamask (i.e. importing a wallet from Metamask) allows you to view orders created and trades filled by Hummingbot on the decentralized exchange's website.


#### Keyfile (recommended)

To import your wallet using its JSON keyfile:

1. Export the JSON keyfile from other wallets such as Metamask, MyCrypto, or MyEtherWallet
2. Save the file in the `/conf` directory
3. Rename the file to `key_file_[address].json`, where `[address]` is the public Ethereum address in the format `0xabc...def`.
4. Start Hummingbot
5. Run `connect` command to confirm if keys are confirmed and added for ethereum.

#### Private key

1. In the Hummingbot client run command `connect ethereum`
2. Ether the private key associated with the wallet

#### Keyfile (recommended)

When you import a wallet with Hummingbot, a JSON file named `key_file_[address].json` is created in the `/conf` directory. This JSON keyfile contains the encrypted private key of your wallet and can be imported into other dApps.

#### Private key

Within the Hummingbot CLI, you can use the `export_private_key` command to display the private key associated with a wallet address. You can import your wallet to dApps like Metamask and MyCrypto using this private key as well.


## Setup Ethereum Nodes 

You need an Ethereum node for strategies that trade on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, such as Radar Relay, Bamboo Relay, and Dolomite.

Run command `config ethereum_rpc_url` to use your Ethereum node with Hummingbot.

```
Which Ethereum node would you like your client to connect to? >>>
```

Below, we list different ways that you can access an Ethereum node.

### Option 1. Infura

[Infura](https://infura.io/) provides free and the most widely used Ethereum nodes.

1. Sign up for an account on infura.io
![infura](infura1.png)
2. Click on **Ethereum** and **Create a project**.
![infura2](/nfura2.png)
3. Name your project and click **Create**.
4. In **Keys** section and under **Endpoints** you'll find your Ethereum node as shown in the highlighted area.
![infura3](infura3.png)
5. The websocket address is below the Ethereum node that starts with `wss://`


### Option 2. Run your own local node

The most decentralized way to access an Ethereum node is to run your own node!

Running your own node may require dedicated storage and compute, as well as some technical skills. These are the two most widely used Ethereum clients:

- [Geth (go-ethereum)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum)
- [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum)

> Note: These may require several hours to days to sync and may require some troubleshooting when first running.

### Option 3. Dedicated blockchain hardware
Get dedicated hardware for your Ethereum node.  Ethereum nodes are meant to run constantly 24/7 and use up a material amount of computational resources (CPU, RAM, and storage).  For more serious users, it may make sense to use dedicated hardware.

#### Software
- [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/) is software that automates the installation and operation of Ethereum (as well as other blockchains) on dedicated hardware.it easier to start and operate an Ethereum node and can run other blockchains.

#### Hardware
- [IntelⓇ NUC mini PC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html): DIY, customize and configure your own hardware.
- [Avado](https://ava.do/): purpose built hardware that is pre-loaded with DAppNode.

## Telegram Integration

![Telegram](/telegram.png)

Integrating Hummingbot with [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/) allows you to get real-time updates and issue commands to your trading bot from any device where you have Telegram installed.

Whether you are running Hummingbot in the cloud or on your local machine, you can use Telegram to monitor and control bots from wherever you are!

> Note: Make sure to install Telegram on your system before setting up your Telegram Bot. If not, you can download Telegram for [Windows/MAC/Linux](https://desktop.telegram.org/) and install.

### Set up your Telegram Bot

Below, we show how to create a Telegram bot that integrates with your Hummingbot deployment.

#### 1. Create the Bot

* Click this link to launch the official **BotFather** bot, a Telegram bot that helps you create and manage Telegram bots: [https://telegram.me/BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).

* In Telegram, go to the newly-created **BotFather** chat pane, and click `Start` or type `/start`.

* Enter `/newbot` to create a bot.

![botfather](botfather-1.png)

* Enter a name for your bot, the title of the bot in Telegram (e.g. `hummingbot`).

![botfather2](botfather-2.png)

* Enter a unique ID that ends with the word `bot` (e.g. `my_awesome_hummingbot`).

![bothfather3](botfather-3.png)

* Take note of the Telegram token in the response above. You'll need it for Step 3 below.

* Click the link to your new bot in the message above launch it: `t.me/<YOUR BOT NAME>`. Click `Start` or type `/start` to start the bot.

#### 2. Get your Telegram ID

* Click this following to launch **userinfobot**, a Telegram bot that helps you retrieve your Telegram ID: [https://telegram.me/userinfobot](https://telegram.me/userinfobot).

* In Telegram, go to the newly-created **userinfobot** chat pane, and click `Start` or type `/start`.

* Take note of the `Id` parameter provided. You'll need it in a minute for the configuration step.

#### 3. Configure the Telegram Settings in Hummingbot

* In the directory where you have installed Hummingbot, go to your global configuration file `conf/conf_global.yml` and edit the following parameters inside the file:

```
telegram_enabled: true
telegram_token: <TELEGRAM TOKEN FROM STEP 1>
telegram_chat_id: <TELEGRAM ID FROM STEP 2>
```

* Locating your global configuration:<br />
    * Installed from source: `hummingbot/conf`<br />
    * Installed via Docker: `hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf`<br />
        `hummingbot_files` is the default name of the parent directory. This can be different depending on the setup
        when the instance was created.<br />
    * Installed via Binary (Windows): `%localappdata%\hummingbot.io\Hummingbot\conf`<br />
    * Installed via Binary (MacOS): `~/Library/Application\ Support/Hummingbot/Conf`<br />

* Alternatively, you can also configure your Telegram bot inside the Hummingbot client by using the following commands:

```
config telegram_enabled
config telegram_token
config telegram_chat_id
```

#### 4. Startup Hummingbot

You can now startup Hummingbot and confirm that the integration is properly configured.

If Hummingbot was running when you configured telegram, make sure to `exit` and restart Hummingbot to reload the telegram configurations.

### Use your Telegram Bot

* Before you start Hummingbot, make sure that the Telegram bot is live. If so, you should see a chat pane with your bot's name in Telegram.

* Now you can start hummingbot as you would normally. Telegram will be connected as soon as you enter `start` in
your hummingbot CLI window.

* Messages are synchronized in real-time between the Telegram bot and the actual Hummingbot instance running. For example, you can use commands such as `status` and `history` to monitor the bot's performance, `config` shows bot current configurations and you can use `start` and `stop` to control the bot.

![telegrambuttons](/telegram-buttons.png)

> Tip: If you are running multiple bots with telegram enabled, you can use same [telegram chat id](https://telegram.me/userinfobot) with different telegram tokens from each bot you created to control all of them.  You can also enable [telegram chat folders](tg://settings/folders) to organize your bots.  Visit [telegram blog page](https://telegram.org/blog/folders) for more info. 

## Advanced Database Configuration

> Warning: This is a recently released experimental feature. Running any trading bots without manual supervision may incur additional risks. It is imperative that you thoroughly understand and test the strategy and parameters before deploying bots that can trade in an unattended manner.

Hummingbot uses SQLite for database by default, but it may be limiting for some cases such as sharing data to external system, in some cases user may want to use their own preferred client/server RDBMS for it.

Other RDBMS are supported on Hummingbot through SQLAlchemy, it has [included some widely used RDBMS dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/index.html), i.e.:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server

These dialects requires separate DBAPI driver to be installed on Hummingbot's conda environment, see [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/index.html) for more information on appropriate DBAPI driver for each RDBMS. For example, to use PostgreSQL, `psycopg2` need to be installed. Run the following command to install it using conda:
```
conda install psycopg2
```
To configure RDBMS connection, we need to edit `conf_global.yml` in `/conf` directory.

```
- Advanced database options, currently supports SQLAlchemy's included dialects
- Reference: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/

db_engine: sqlite
db_host: 127.0.0.1
db_port: '3306'
db_username: username
db_password: password
db_name: dbname
```

### Configuration Parameters

| Configuration Parameter | Possible Values |
|---|---|
| db_engine |`sqlite`,`postgres`,`mysql`,`oracle`,`mssql`|
| db_host | any string e.g. `127.0.0.1` |
| db_port | any string e.g. `3306` |
| db_username | any string e.g. `username` |
| db_password | any string e.g. `password` |
| db_name | any string e.g. `dbname` |

### SQLAlchemy Dialects
It is also possible to connect with available SQLAlchemy's external dialects (e.g. Amazon Redshift). But the feature is not currently supported in Hummingbot due to its various DSN format, **use this at your own risk**.
