## Start Hummingbot via Docker

Creating a new instance of Hummingbot with `docker run` will automatically start the Hummingbot client.

To run a previously created, stopped container where \$NAME is the name of your instance of Hummingbot:

```sh
docker start $NAME && docker attach $NAME
```

### Start Hummingbot running in the background

Use the start script by running the command `./start.sh` to attach to a Hummingbot instance running in the background.

For additional information on useful commands, see the [commands](/operation/command-ref) to running Hummingbot on Docker.

## Start Hummingbot from Source

**Prerequisites:**

- Crypto Inventory: In order to run trading bot, you'll need some inventory of crypto assets available on the exchange, or in your Ethereum wallet (for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges).
  Remember that you need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). For example, if you are making a market in a `BTC/USDT` trading pair, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`.
  In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges. For more information, please see [Connectors](/exchange-connectors/overview/).
- API Keys: In order to run a bot on a centralized exchange like Binance, you will need to enter the exchange API keys during the Hummingbot configuration process.
  For more information on how to get the API keys for each exchange, please see the individual exchange pages in [Connectors](/exchange-connectors/overview/).
- Ethereum Wallet: In order to earn rewards from Liquidity Bounties, you need an Ethereum wallet. In addition, you'll need to import an Ethereum wallet when you run a trading bot on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.
  For more information on creating or importing an Ethereum wallet, see [Ethereum wallet](/operation/adv-command-ref/#setup-ethereum-wallet).
- Ethereum Node (DEX only): When you run a trading bot on a Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, your wallet sends signed transactions to the blockchain via an Ethereum node.
  For more information, see [Ethereum node](/operation/adv-command-ref/#setup-ethereum-nodes).

<Callout type="note" body="Make sure that you activate the Anaconda environment with `conda activate hummingbot` prior to running Hummingbot." />

Open a Terminal window and go to the root of the directory that contains Hummingbot. From there, run:

```
bin/hummingbot.py
```

### Re-compiling

This section walks you through re-compiling Hummingbot after a code change.

```
# 1) Clean intermediate and compiled files from Cython compilation.
./clean

# 2) Install
./install

# 3) Deactivate old conda environment
conda deactivate

# 4) Activate conda environment
conda activate hummingbot

# 5) Compile
./compile

# 6) Run Hummingbot
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## Create a secure password

If you are using Hummingbot for the first time on this machine, the system will prompt you to create a password. This password will be used to encrypt sensitive configuration settings e.g. API keys, secret keys and wallet private keys.

<Callout type="warning" body="For security reasons, the password is only stored locally in encrypted form. #We do not have access to your password.#" />

## User Interface

![Hummingbot CLI](/img/hummingbot-cli.png)

The CLI is divided into five panes:

- **Input pane (lower left)**: Where users enter commands

- **Log pane (right)**: Log messages
- **Top navigation bar**: Displays the status/information of following items
  - Version:
  - paper_trade_mode:
  - Strategy:
  - Strategy_file:
- **Bottom navigation bar**:Displays the information of following items
  - Trades
  - Total P&L
  - Return%
  - CPU
  - Mem
  - Threads
  - Duration

## Strategy-specific Files

The `create` command walks you through the process of initializing and configuring the global and strategy-specific settings necessary to run the bot. Running the command will create the following files in the `conf/` folder:

| File                                 | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conf_global.yml`                    | Global configuration settings, e.g. Binance API keys and Ethereum node.                              |
| `conf_pure_mm_[#].yml`               | Settings for the [pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making/) strategy.                     |
| `conf_xemm_[#].yml`                  | Settings for the [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/) strategy. |
| `conf_perpetual_market_making_#.yml` | Settings for the [perpetual market making](/strategies/perpetual-market-making) strategy.            |
| `conf_arb_[#].yml`                   | Settings for the [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage/) strategy.                                       |
| `conf_celo_arb_[#].yml`              | Settings for the [celo arbitrage](/strategies/celo-arb/) strategy.                                   |
| `conf_amm_arb_[#].yml`               | Settings for the [amm arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/) strategy.                                     |

<Callout type="tip" body="For editing configuration files directly, once they are created, you may find it easier to edit the configuration files in the `conf/` folder. Simply open them with a text editor and make any desired modifications." />

## Setup Walkthrough

When running `create`, you are asked to select a strategy and enter strategy-specific configuration parameters. We have developed walkthroughs for each strategy:

- [Pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making)
- [Cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making)
- [Perpetual Market Making](/strategies/perpetual-market-making)
- [Arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage)
- [Celo Arbitrage](/strategies/celo-arb/)
- [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/)

<Callout type="note" body="When configuring your bot, make sure you are aware of your exchange's minimum order sizes and fees, and check that your trading pair has sufficient order book and trading volumes. You can find more info about specific exchanges in the [Connectors] section." link={["/exchange-connectors/overview/"]} />

## API keys

In order to trade on a centralized exchange, you will need to import your API key from that exchange to Hummingbot using the `connect [exchange_name]` command. API keys are account specific credentials that allow access to live information and trading outside of the exchange website.

Please see [Connectors](/exchange-connectors/overview/) for exchanges that Hummingbot currently and instructions to find your API keys.

<Callout type="note" body="We recommend using only #trade# enabled API keys; enabling #withdraw, transfer, or the equivalent# is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies." />

## Config File Templates

This configuration files created and used by Hummingbot are saved in the `conf/` directory of your instance, which you can edit directly with a standard text editor.

The template configuration files can be found here: [Config Templates](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/templates).

<Callout type="warning" body="Exit Hummingbot and ensure it is not running when you modify the config files. Changes will take effect the next time Hummingbot is started." />
