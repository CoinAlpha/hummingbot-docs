** balance limit [ exchange ] [ asset ] [ amount ] **

Set the amount limit on how much assets Hummingbot can use in an exchange or wallet. This can be useful when running multiple bots on different trading pairs with same tokens e.g. running a BTC-USDT pair and another bot on ETH-USDT using the same account.

```
>>>  balance limit binance USDT 100
Limit for USDT on binance exchange set to 100.0
```

Run the `balance` command again to confirm the limit has been applied.

```

## Example Scenario

Create pure market making strategy, run `config` to view the whole configuration.

![config](/img/config1.png)

Run `balance limit binance ETH 0.051263` to set the balance limit to 0.0513 ETH.
Run `balance limit binance USDT 30` to set the balance limit to 30 USDT.
Both ETH and USDT value is equivalent to $30.  

![balance limit](/img/run_balance.png)

Each order is 0.0188 equivalent to $11.20

![order amount](/img/order_amount.png)

Sell order gets filled. USDT available balance is now 30.1657

![sell order](/img/sell_filled.png)

Another sell order gets filled, the available balance now shows 41.2069. 
Plus the open buy order, the "usable" balance on USDT is now at around $52

![sell order](/img/sell_filled2.png)

After the two sell orders gets filled the remaining available balance in ETH is 0.0137 equivalent to $8.17. 
It means that after the next `order_refresh_time` it won't create sell order because the minimum order amount is $11. 

![buy order](/img/buy_order.png)

![buy order](/img/buy_order1.png)

Same process as the scenario above. After the two buy orders gets filled the remaining available balance in USDT is 7.5317 equivalent to $7.53. 
It means that after the next `order_refresh_time` it won't create buy order because the minimum order amount is $11. 

![buy order buy](/img/buy_order_buy.png)

** balance paper **

Show existing paper account balance setting.

```
>>>  balance paper
Paper account balances:
    Asset    Balance
      DAI  1000.0000
      ETH    10.0000
      ONE  1000.0000
     TUSD  1000.0000
     USDC  1000.0000

     USDT  1000.0000
     WETH    10.0000
      ZRX  1000.0000
```

** balance paper [ asset ] [ amount ] **

Set the amount of asset balance for paper trading mode. For example, we want to add 0.5 BTC to our paper account balance.

```
>>>  balance paper BTC 0.5
Paper balance for BTC token set to 0.5

>>>  balance paper
Paper account balances:
    Asset    Balance
      BTC     0.5000
      DAI  1000.0000
      ETH    10.0000
      ONE  1000.0000
     TUSD  1000.0000
     USDC  1000.0000
     USDQ  1000.0000

** How It Works **

The `history` command in Hummingbot displays the current duration of total past trades, assets inventory and value, and market trading pair performance.

The following displays the formula for key calculations:

> **Note:** For more details on all the indidvual item formula, see [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zp8EmeJdiP5soR_Bu7hRjaSy65bc7lsg98J5jKanRn8/edit#gid=875477664)for the formulas in the cells.

** Avg Price **

Avg Price = Total trade volume of quote/Total trade volume of base asset

From the above example, for the total avg price is 6.91/47423 = 0.0001457

This value means the average price of total MFT/BNB trades is 0.0001457

**Hold portfolio value**

The asset value from the start to the end with no trades.

Hold portfolio value = (base start asset\*quote current value)+ quote start asset

From the above example, for the Hold portfolio value is (155248\*0.0000809)+23.33=35.89

**Current portfolio value**

Current portfolio value = (quote current asset\*quote current value)+ quote current asset

From the above example, for the Hold portfolio value is (202671\*0.0000809)+16.419=32.815

**Trade P&L**

Trade P&L = Current portfolio value - Hold Portfolio value

From the above example, for the Trade P&L value is 32.815-35.89=-3.075

**Tota P&L**

Total P&L = Trade P&L + Fees paid

From the above example, for the Total P&L is -3.075 + -0.428 = -3.504

** Return Percentage **

Return% = Total P&L/Hold portfolio value

From the above example, for the Return% is -3.075/-35.89 = -9.76%

> **Note:** The **Return%** (bottom navbar) matches the calculated return on history after the last trade, see following screenshot:
> ![Same price](/img/same-price.png)

## paper_trade

Toggle paper trade mode on and off. When paper trade mode is enabled, all orders are simulated and no real orders are placed.

This feature allows users to test Hummingbot and simulate trading strategies without risking any actual assets. Enter the command `paper_trade` to enable this feature.

<!--
```
>>>  paper_trade

Enable paper trading mode (Yes/No) ? >>> Yes

New configuration saved:
paper_trade_enabled: True
```
-->

![papertrade](/img/paper_trade.gif)

** Enabling and Disabling **

Paper trading mode can be enabled/disabled inside Hummingbot by doing `paper_trade` or `config paper_trade_enabled`.

Alternatively, you can edit the `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor and set `paper_trade_enabled:` value to `true` or `false`.

- Locating your global configuration:<br />
  - Installed from source: `hummingbot/conf`<br />
  - Installed via Docker: `hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf`<br />
    `hummingbot_files` is the default name of the parent directory. This can be different depending on the setup
    when the instance was created.<br />
  - Installed via Binary (Windows): `%localappdata%\hummingbot.io\Hummingbot\conf`<br />
  - Installed via Binary (MacOS): `~/Library/Application\ Support/Hummingbot/Conf`<br />

The top bar shows the status to indicate if paper trading mode is on or off.

![papertrade2](/img/paper_trade_mode2.png)

Also shows a reminder that paper trade was enabled when doing a `status` or `history` command.

![papertrade3](/img/paper_trade_warning.png)

** Account Balance **

By default, the paper trade account has the following tokens and balances:

```
paper_trade_account_balance:
  BTC: 1
  USDT: 1000
  ONE: 1000
  USDQ: 1000
  TUSD: 1000
  ETH: 10
  WETH: 10
  USDC: 1000
  DAI: 1000
```

Paper trade assets can be added in two ways:

1. Run `balance paper [asset] [amount]`. See more information in [balance](/operation/command-ref/#balance) command.
2. Edit `conf_global.yml` in the `/conf` or `hummingbot_conf` folder using a text editor. **Strictly follow the same format above**.

> **Note:**

- When making changes to the global config file, make sure to exit and restart Hummingbot to take effect.

By default, the `order_book` command shows only the maker market in cross-exchange strategy or primary market when using arbitrage.

You can use arguments `--live` to displays the orderbook of the market in real time . For example, run `order_book --lines 20 --live`.
The order book displays the top 20 bid/ask prices and volume of the current market in real time.

![orderbook-live](/img/orderbook-20lines-live.gif)

**Optional arguments**

arguments `--exchange` and `--market` allows you to check the order book of the taker market or secondary market.

Sample usage:

```
>>>  order_book --exchange kucoin --market ETH-USDT
  market: kucoin ETH-USDT

     bid_price  bid_volume  ask_price  ask_volume
         395.8        1.07     395.81        2.02
        395.79    22.95406     395.82   0.0505293
        395.77    7.668467     395.84    0.554996
        395.75        0.05     395.85    3.644207
         395.7           1     395.86       1.825
```

## kill switch

Automatically stops the bot when it reaches a certain performance threshold, which can be either positive or negative. This feature uses the same performance calculation methodology as the [history](/operation/command-ref#history) command.

```
Would you like to enable the kill switch? (Yes/No) >>>
At what profit/loss rate would you like the bot to stop? (e.g. -5 equals 5 percent loss) >>>
```

You can always reconfigure this feature in two ways:

1. Inside Hummingbot run command `config kill_switch_enabled` and/or `config kill_switch_rate`.
2. Edit `conf_global.yml` file using a text editor.

Note that when the market prices changes, so does the bot's performance and may trigger the kill switch. For example, we executed 13 trades and our performance are shown below.

```json
- kill_switch_enabled: True
- kill_switch_rate: -0.3
```

```
Inventory:
      Market Asset  Starting   Current  Net Delta Trade Delta
  0  binance   ETH   10.0000   11.0000     1.0000      3.0000
  1  binance  USDT  500.0000  297.1580  -202.8420   -610.6340

Markets:
      Market     Pair Start Price       End Price  Trades Trade Value Delta
  0  binance  ETHUSDT     203.913  202.7150000000      13  -2.48900000 USDT

  Duration: 0 days 00:07:06
  Total Trade Value Delta: -2.489 USDT
  Return %: -0.0985 %
```

After a while, the end price changed from 202.715 to 200.54 and so did our bot's performance even without making more trades. Since `kill_switch_rate` is set to `-0.3` this will stop the strategy.

```

## ticker

Displays market ticker prices such as best bid, best ask, mid price and last trade price.

When optional arguments are not used i.e. running `ticker` alone displays the output from the **maker market** of a cross-exchange strategy or **primary market** when using arbitrage.

> **Note:** This command will only work while a strategy is running.

**Optional arguments**

| Command Argument | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--exchange`     | The specific exchange of the market       |
| `--market`       | The market trading pair of the order book |
| `--live`         | Displays the ticker in real time          |

You can use arguments `--live` to displays market ticker prices such as best bid, best ask, mid price and last trade price in real time. For example, run `ticker --live`.

![ticker-live](/img/ticker-live.gif)

**Sample usage**

When running a cross-exchange or arbitrage strategy, you can specify which exchange and market you can display.

```
>>>  ticker --exchange binance --market ETH-USDT

   Best Bid  Best Ask  Mid Price  Last Trade
   351.41    351.42    351.415      351.42
