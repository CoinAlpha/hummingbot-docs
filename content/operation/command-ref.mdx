When optional arguments are not used i.e. running `ticker` alone displays the output from the **maker market** of a cross-exchange strategy or **primary market** when using arbitrage.

> **Note:** This command will only work while a strategy is running.

**Optional arguments**

| `--exchange`     | The specific exchange of the market       |
| `--market`       | The market trading pair of the order book |
| `--live`         | Displays the ticker in real time          |
