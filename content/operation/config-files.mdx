## Creating a new strategy file

Run `create` command and answer the prompts to configure your bot's behavior depending on the strategy you want to use.

The last prompt will ask you to enter a name for the config file. You can also specify the name of your file at the beginning by running `create [file_name]` command.

## Config File Templates

These configuration files created and used by Hummingbot are saved in the `conf/` directory of your instance, which you can edit directly with a standard text editor.

- Installed from source: `hummingbot/conf`
- Installed via Docker: `hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf`
  - `hummingbot_files` is the default name of the parent directory. This can be different depending on the setup
    when the instance was created.
- Installed via Binary (Windows): `%localappdata%\hummingbot.io\Hummingbot\conf`
- Installed via Binary (MacOS): `~/Library/Application\ Support/Hummingbot/Conf`

The template configuration files can be found here: [Config Templates](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/templates).

## Strategy-specific Files

Running `create` command initializes the configuration of global and strategy-specific settings necessary to run the bot.

Running this command will automatically create the following files in these folders:

| File                                    | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conf_global.yml`                       | Global configuration settings, e.g. Binance API keys and Ethereum node.                              |
| `conf_pure_mm_[#].yml`                  | Settings for the [pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making/) strategy.                     |
| `conf_xemm_[#].yml`                     | Settings for the [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/) strategy. |
| `conf_liquidity_mining_[#].yml`         | Settings for the [liquidity mining](/strategies/liquidity-mining/) strategy.                         |
| `conf_perpetual_market_making_#.yml`    | Settings for the [perpetual market making](/strategies/perpetual-market-making) strategy.            |
| `conf_arb_[#].yml`                      | Settings for the [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage/) strategy.                                       |
| `conf_celo_arb_[#].yml`                 | Settings for the [celo arbitrage](/strategies/celo-arb/) strategy.                                   |
| `conf_amm_arb_[#].yml`                  | Settings for the [amm arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/) strategy.                                     |
| `conf_spot_perpetual_arbitrage_[#].yml` | Settings for the [spot perpetual arbitrage](/strategies/spot-perpetual-arb/) strategy.               |
| `conf_avellaneda_market_making_[#].yml` | Settings for the [avellaneda market making](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/) strategy.         |

## Setup Walkthrough

After running `create` command, you need to setup a strategy along with its parameters.

We have developed walkthroughs for each strategy:

- [Pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making)
- [Cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making)
- [Perpetual Market Making](/strategies/perpetual-market-making)
- [Arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage)
- [Celo Arbitrage](/strategies/celo-arb/)
- [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/)
- [Liquidity Mining](/strategies/liquidity-mining/)
- [Spot Perpetual Arbitrage](/strategies/spot-perpetual-arb/)
- [Avellaneda Market Making](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/)

## Import an existing strategy file

1. Run `import` command
2. Enter the name of your strategy config file

You can also skip the prompt by running `import [file_name]` command.

## Autofill import

Choose between `start` and `config` after importing a strategy file. This will be applicable for all imported strategies.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="What to auto-fill in the prompt after each import command? (start/config)"
  response=">>>"
/>

**Sample usage**

`autofill_import = start`

```
>>>`import conf_pure_mm_1.yml`
Configuration from conf_pure_mm_1.yml file is imported.

Preliminary checks:
 - Exchange check: All connections confirmed.
 - Strategy check: All required parameters confirmed.
 -All checks: Confirmed.

Enter "start" to start market making

>>> start

```

Here's an example if using the config command
`autofill_import = config`

```
>>>`import conf_pure_mm_1.yml`
Configuration from conf_pure_mm_1.yml file is imported.

Preliminary checks:
 - Exchange check: All connections confirmed.
 - Strategy check: All required parameters confirmed.
 -All checks: Confirmed.

Enter "start" to start market making

>>> config

```

## Create command shortcuts

To use this feature, open and configure `conf_global.yml`.

Import the lines of code to create a custom command shortcut.

```
# Command Shortcuts
# Define abbreviations for often used commands
# or batch grouped commands together

command_shortcuts:
  # Assign shortcut command
  command: spreads_refresh

  # Reference
  help: Set bid spread, ask spread, and order refresh time

  # Argument Label
  arguments: [Bid Spread, Ask Spread, Order Refresh Time]

  # Original config output with value
  output: [config bid_spread $1, config ask_spread $2, config order_refresh_time $3]
```
