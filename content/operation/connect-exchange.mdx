## Requirements

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

### API keys

When trading on a centralized exchange, you will need to connect Hummingbot and the exchange using API keys. These are account-specific credentials that allow access to live information and trading outside of the exchange website. Follow the instructions specific to your exchange on how to create API keys.

Example:

- [How to create Binance API key](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072)
- [How to create KuCoin API key](https://support.kucoin.plus/hc/en-us/articles/360015102174-How-to-Create-an-API)
- [How to create Coinbase Pro API key](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/other-topics/api/how-do-i-create-an-api-key-for-coinbase-pro)

<Callout
  type="warning"
  body="We recommend using only #read + trade# enabled API keys. It is not necessary to enable #withdraw#, #transfer#, or anything equivalent to retrieving assets from your wallet."
/>

### Wallet private keys

Strategies that transact on decentralized exchanges and protocols directly interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, transactions must be signed and authorized, which requires your private key. Check with your wallet provider on how to export private keys.

Example:

- [MetaMask - How to Export an Account Private Key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key)

### Ethereum node

An Ethereum node is required when trading on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges or protocols. There are different ways you can access an Ethereum node.

1. [Infura](https://infura.io/) provides free and the most widely used Ethereum node. Their blog post below provides more information, including how to access:
   - [Getting started with Infura](https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infura-28e41844cc89/)
1. **Running your own local node.** It may require dedicated storage and compute, as well as some technical skills. Note that these may require several hours to sync and may require some troubleshooting when first running. These are the two most widely used Ethereum clients:
   - [Geth (go-ethereum)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum)
   - [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum)
1. **Using dedicated blockchain hardware.** Ethereum nodes are meant to constantly run 24/7 and use up a material amount of computational resources (CPU, RAM, and storage). For more serious users, it may make sense to use dedicated hardware.
   - [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/) is software that automates the installation and operation of Ethereum (as well as other blockchains) on dedicated hardware. It is easier to start and operate an Ethereum node and can run other blockchains.

## Adding or replacing keys in Hummingbot

### Connect to exchanges

1. Run `connect [exchange_name]` command e.g., `connect binance` will prompt connection to Binance exchange
1. Enter API and secret keys when prompted
1. Other exchanges may require additional details such as account ID, exchange address, etc.

### Connect to Ethereum

Follow the instructions below to connect to decentralized exchanges or protocol running on Ethereum such as Balancer, Uniswap, and Perpetual Finance.

1. Run `connect ethereum` command
1. Enter your wallet private key
1. Enter the Ethereum node endpoint starting with https://
1. Enter the websocket address starting with wss://

## Checking connection status

Run the `connect` command to view the connection status. It also shows failed connections due to connectivity issues, invalid API key permissions, etc.

**Keys Added** column indicates if API keys are added to Hummingbot.

**Keys Confirmed** column shows the status if Hummingbot has successfully connected to the exchange or protocol.

**Connector Status** column is an indicator if there are known issues with the connector or working correctly. More info in [Spot Connector Status](/spot-connectors/overview) and [Protocol Connector Status](/protocol-connectors/overview).
