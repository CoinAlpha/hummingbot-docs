## Docker scripts

These commands execute the helper scripts for running Hummingbot and are performed from the terminal or shell. Ensure that the scripts are located in your current directory before running these commands.

| Command     | Function                                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ./create.sh | Creates a new instance of Hummingbot                                   |
| ./start.sh  | Connect to a running instance or restart an exited Hummingbot instance |
| ./update.sh | Update Hummingbot version                                              |

> **Tip:** Run the command `ls -l` to check the files in your current working directory.

### Updating your scripts

We sometimes add/remove/edit commands in the helper scripts along with certain new features like the [Scripts](/release-notes/0.29.0) we released in version 0.29.0 and you would need to update your scripts.

Copy the commands below and paste into the shell or terminal to delete the old scripts and download the most recently updated ones.
