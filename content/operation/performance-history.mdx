## History Command

The `history` command displays the current duration of total past trades, asset inventory and value, and market trading pair performance. Run `history --verbose` to see all recent trades.

Trades are saved locally in a .csv file located in the `data` folder which you can view by running `history --verbose --days` command even after you restart Hummingbot.

Optional argument `--precision` specifies the number of decimal values.

This block below shows the calculation for some of the values displayed in the history output.

```bash
Avg price = total trade volume of quote / total trade volume of base asset
Hold portfolio value = (base start asset * current market price) + quote start asset
Current portfolio value = (base current asset * current market price) + quote current asset
Trade P&L = current portfolio value - hold portfolio value
Total P&L = trade P&L + fees paid
Return % = total P&L / hold portfolio value
```

<Callout
  type="tip"
  body="The Return % in the navbar at the bottom of Hummingbot client may be different from the history command output. This is because the Return % in history takes the price changes into calculation while the navbar in the bottom UI does not."
/>

## Profit & Loss

The `pnl` command shows consolidated performance for all running bots in the same Binance account. This command can be useful when participating in Liquidity Mining campaigns.

| `--days`               | How many days in the past (can be decimal value) |

| `--open_order_markets` | See pnl from current open order markets          |

### Adding trading pairs

If your desired Binance trading pair(s) does not show in the output, you can add them in two ways:

1. Edit `binance_markets` list in `conf_global.yml` located in the `conf` folder
2. Run `config binance_markets` from the Hummingbot terminal
