## Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (refer to our guide [here](/operation/connect-exchange/#setup-ethereum-wallet))
- Ethereum node (refer to our guide [here](/operation/connect-exchange/#setup-ethereum-nodes))
- Hummingbot Gateway (done after connecting to Balancer)
- Some ETH in wallet for gas
- Inventory on both base and quote assets for the connectors

## Connecting to Balancer

When creating Hummingbot Gateway, it picks up the Ethereum settings in the global config file, which we can set up in the Hummingbot client.

1. Run the command `connect ethereum` in the Hummingbot client
2. Enter your wallet private key
3. Enter Ethereum node address (starts with https://)
4. Enter the WebSocket connection address of your Ethereum node (starts with wss://)
