title: Balancer (BETA)
---

Balancer is an automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor, in other words, a decentralized finance protocol based on Ethereum that allows automatic market making.

> **NOTE:** This connector has undergone code review, internal testing and was shipped during one of our most recent releases. As part of User Acceptance Testing, we encourage users to report any issues with this connector to our [Discord server](https://discord.hummingbot.io) or [submit a bug report](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).


## Inventory

- Similar to the arbitrage strategy, you will need to hold inventory of trading pairs in Ethereum wallet and on a secondary exchange, in order to be able to trade and capture price differentials
- You also need some Gas in order to pay for transaction fees on the submit transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Connecting to Balancer

As Balancer is not a typical centralized exchange but a Ethereum-based automated market maker protocol, you need to install a gateway to connect. See [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/) for details.

## ETH Gas Station (Optional)

Users have the option to use and configure DeFi Pulse Gas Price as the gas estimator.

1. Sign up for a free account on [DeFi Pulse Data](https://data.defipulse.com/signup)
2. Get your API key - once you log into DeFi Pulse Data, your API key can be found on the right side of the Dashboard. Click the copy button to copy your API Key.

3. From the Hummingbot client, run `config ethgasstation_gas_enabled`, and enter `True`
4. Run `config ethgasstation_api_key` and enter the DeFi Pulse Data API key
5. Run `config ethgasstation_gas_level` and select desired gas level from `fast`, `fastest`, `safeLow`, `average`.

> **NOTE:** For calculation details on the various gas level, see [DeFi Pulse Data API docs](https://docs.defipulse.com/api-docs-by-provider/egs/gas-price).

6. This step is optional if you want to override the default Gas Station refresh time of 120 seconds. Do this by running the command `config ethgasstation_refresh_time`.
