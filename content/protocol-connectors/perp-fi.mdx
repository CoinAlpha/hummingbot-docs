Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized perpetual contract trading protocol for every asset, with a Uniswap-inspired Virtual Automated Market Makers (Virtual AMMs) and a built-in Staking Reserve which backs and secures the Virtual AMMs.

## Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (refer to our guide [here](/operation/adv-command-ref/#setup-ethereum-wallet))
- Ethereum node (refer to our guide [here](/operation/adv-command-ref/#setup-ethereum-nodes))
- Hummingbot Gateway (done after connecting to Perpetual Finance)
- Some ETH in wallet for gas
- Some xDai asset for transaction fee
- USDC - all trades are funded and settled in USDC. You can obtain USDC at any major exchange, such as Uniswap

## Connecting to Perpetual Finance

When creating Hummingbot Gateway, it picks up the Ethereum settings in the global config file which we can set up in the Hummingbot client.

1. Run the command `connect ethereum` in the Hummingbot client
2. Enter your wallet private key
3. Enter Ethereum node address (starts with https://)
4. Enter the websocket connection address of your Ethereum node (starts with wss://)
