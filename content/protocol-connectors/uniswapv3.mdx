title: Uniswap v3
---

import Callout from "../../src/components/Callout";

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is a protocol on Ethereum for swapping ERC20 tokens. Unlike most exchanges, which are designed to take fees, Uniswap is designed to function as a public good — a tool for the community trade tokens without platform fees or middlemen.

Concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers are the new features behind Uniswap v3, giving the liquidity provider more control of risk and assets.

## Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (refer to our guide [here](/operation/connect-exchange/#setup-ethereum-wallet))
- Ethereum node (refer to our guide [here](/operation/connect-exchange/#setup-ethereum-nodes))
- Hummingbot Gateway (done after connecting to Uniswap)
- Some ETH in wallet for gas
- Inventory on both base and quote assets for the connectors

## Connecting to Uniswap

When creating Hummingbot Gateway, it picks up the Ethereum settings in the global config file which we can set up in the Hummingbot client.

1. Run the command `connect ethereum` in the Hummingbot client
2. Enter your wallet private key
3. Enter Ethereum node address (starts with https://)
4. Enter the websocket connection address of your Ethereum node (starts with wss://)
