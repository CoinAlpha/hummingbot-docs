üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.12.0! In this release, we focused on stability, optimization, and addressing numerous reported bugs.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Introducing inventory-based dynamic order sizing

The pure market-making strategy now includes a feature that modifies the size of your bid/ask orders to maintain a target ratio of base to quote asset. For example, if you are trading ETH-USDT and are targeting a 50%/50% ratio of ETH to USDT, if the value of your ETH holdings accounts for more than 50% of your current portfolio, the bid (buy ETH) size will be reduced while the ask (sell ETH) size will be increased.

Read more about this feature [here](/strategies/inventory-skew/).

## üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**

- Fixed bug that shows all trades as "sell" in trade history.
- Fixed bug preventing restarting of a bot in telegram after kill switch is triggered.
- Re-enabled the `bounty` command in telegram.
- Updated ERC20 token register for recent new tokens.
- Added docker image label (`docker inspect INSTANCE`) to show which version of Hummingbot code is being used by that container for debugging/attribution.
