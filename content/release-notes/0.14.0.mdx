üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.14.0! This release includes a new Huobi connector and improved developer documentation.

## üîó New Huobi Global connector

Hummingbot now support [Huobi Global](https://www.hbg.com)! You can read more about how to use the Huobi Global connector in the [user manual](/exchange-connectors/huobi/).

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that there are some known issues for this connector which we are working on:

- Failure to cancel orders may result in Hummingbot losing track of some placed orders
- [issue #745: batch cancel](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/745)
- [issue #750: cancel order](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/750)

## ü§ì Developer usability

Our efforts to make the Hummingbot code base more understandable and easier to use for developers continues, with additional documentation for strategies:

- Developer documentation for [arbitrage strategy](/developer/arbitrage/).
- Developer documentation for discovery strategy.

## üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**

- Remove bounty status from Hummingbot client to optimize server performance; users should instead use the Harmony \$ONE Makers leadboard to look up their bounty information.
- Fix discovery strategy currency symbol input formatting.
- Fix IDEX repeated `cancelled order` notifications when running `stop`.

## üöÄ Coming soon

Here's what we currently working on that we expect to ship in the next 2-6 weeks:

- **Paper trading mode**: this is a major feature and we have made a lot of progress. It is nearly complete and we are currently testing and reviewing, aiming to have this feature included in the next release, 0.15.0
- Improvements to the **cross exchange market making** strategy
- Improvements to the **pure market making** strategy
- New connector: **Bittrex**
