title: "Version 0.19.0"

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.19.0! In this release, we focused on working and testing upcoming connectors along with addressing identified and reported bugs.

## üìä Important update on UI

- We have created a consistent interface for all trading pairs on different exchanges, which means when you configure your bot,
  You can enter "BASE-QUOTE" (e.g. ETH-USDT) for your trading pair input on any exchange.

  However, this means you have to edit all of your old config files and replace any trading_pair / symbol inputs with the new
  format.

## ü§ì Developer usability

- Tutorial for creating custom strategies now has its dedicated section. It is currently a work-in-progress, but you can check out the initial parts [here](/developer/build-strategy/).
- [Architecture](/developer/architecture/) section that includes additional details for adding new connectors.
- Added detailed examples to [Building Connectors](/developer/overview/) in using air console for testing.

## üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**
