üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.20.0! In this release, we mainly addressed a number of bugs. Separately from the `hummingbot` client, the team has been hard at work on the Liquidity Mining infrastructure, with campaigns on target for a mid-February launch.

## ü§ñ UI Update

- We have added a feature that allows you to encrypt and decrypt your exchange API keys. Please review `Step 3: Configure a market making bot` in our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.hummingbot.io/quickstart/configure/) for more details.

## üåä‚õè Liquidity mining update

In mid February 2020, we plan to launch liquidity mining campaigns for our launch partners on 0x Mesh and Binance. There will be approximately US \$3,000-\$8,000 per month in rewards for liquidity miners to earn in each campaign.

Also, we recently released a blog explaining how liquidity mining rewards are calculated on our new platform. For more information, read through our blog posts:

## üîó Connectors update

- Finished Liquid.com exchange connector (Thanks to [@zeitgeistf](https://github.com/zeitgeistf))
- Finished Bitcoin.com exchange connector (Thanks to [@nionis](https://github.com/nionis))
- Bamboo Relay upgraded to 0x v3 protocol and can now be used with Hummingbot.

## ü§ì Developer usability
