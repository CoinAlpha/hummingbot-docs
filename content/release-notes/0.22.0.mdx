title: "Version 0.22.0"
---

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.22.0! In this release, we added an external pricing source feature, addressed a number of bugs, and continuously working on the Liquidity Mining infrastructure.

## üìä External Pricing Source

By default, pure market-making strategy uses the order book‚Äôs mid price to calculate limit order prices. We added a feature that allows you to use another mid-price from external sources such as another exchange, data feed, or an external API.

You may read through [External Pricing Source Configuration](/strategies/external-price-source/#when-to-use-an-external-price-source) in the user manual for more information.

## üîó Radar Relay upgrade to 0x v3

The Radar Relay connector is broken right now because they recently moved their API to a new version. You may encounter errors or bugs when using the connector in this version. We will send an announcement in future release notes once Hummingbot‚Äôs connector is updated.

## üìì Documentation updates

Here we list recent significant changes to Hummingbot docs:

- Added [Hummingbot Help Center](https://hummingbot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/)
- Added External Pricing Source Configuration in Pure Market Making strategy
- Added steps in the Troubleshooting section on how to locate the data folder where hummingbot_trades.sqlite folder is stored when running via Docker
- Added information in the Troubleshooting section about Binance
- Removed Bitcoin.com Exchange since this is no longer supported
