üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.23.0! In this release, we are excited to announce the open beta of Liquidity Mining, a new connector, easier to use pure market making strategy, and addressed a number of bugs.

## üåä‚õè Liquidity mining open beta

We are excited to launch the Liquidity Mining Open Beta today! During the 4-week testing period, we welcome anyone who‚Äôs interested to join us and try the [Hummingbot Miners App](https://miners.hummingbot.io). We will work hard to collect user feedback and fix bugs so that we can provide a great user experience when we go live on March 2, 2020.

## üìä Pure market making configuration simplified

Pure market making now has a basic/advanced split that will only prompt during configuration of the basic parameters such as the exchange name, trading pair, bid/ask spreads, cancel order wait time, and order amount.

Users can configure the advanced features of this strategy by entering `Yes` when prompted, via `config <parameter>` command in Hummingbot, or by editing the strategy config file.

More information about [Basic Mode](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/#basic-mode) and [Advanced Mode](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/#advanced-mode) of Pure Market Making in our User Manual.

## üîó New KuCoin connector

Hummingbot now supports [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) exchange! Nicknamed the "People's Exchange"‚Äã, Kucoin is easy to use for novice investors and in-depth enough for crypto enthusiasts. It has one of the world‚Äôs most impressive trading pair selections, a wide range of alt coins with more than 300 trading pairs and are adding new ones regularly.

Read more about how to use KuCoin connector in the [User Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/kucoin/).

## üìú Error log collection

Instead of using the old `hummingbot_logs.yml` templates for sending logs, we now added a prompt in Hummingbot that allows users to enable or disabled sending errors logs.

Read through [Logs and Logging](/operation/adv-command-ref/#error-log-collection) section of our Utilities page for more information.

## ü§ì Developer documentation

We created a guide that walks you through how to prepare your development environment and get started developing for Hummingbot using Linux, macOS and Windows.
