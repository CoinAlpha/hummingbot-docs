üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.25.0! In this release, we continued working on the Liquidity Mining back-end's stability, scaling/optimizing the infrastructure for quicker updates and increased capacity. There are also major improvements in pure market-making strategy, including inventory skew, status outputs, hanging order mode, and filled order delays.

## üö∞ Updated dependencies to improve stability

To address memory leaks that cause the bot to crash, we upgraded Python to version 3.8 and `prompt-toolkit`, the client interface framework. These fixes should significantly improve bot stability and reduce crashes due to memory leaks.

In addition, we advise users to not `stop` and `start` the bot frequently before running it long-term. This appears to elevate memory usage and cause the bot to crash more often. We continue to monitor this issue.

  body="`Updating from source` Due to the updated Python version, users who install Hummingbot from source need to run `./uninstall` and `./clean` before updating."

## üí• New `status` command

We made some changes to how bot `status` is displayed to make it more informative for users.

- Added a new section if **Inventory Skew** is enabled
- Added **Spread** to show the order's spread from the mid-price
- Added **Age** column to show how long orders are outstanding from the time when created
- Added **Hang** column to indicate if the active order is hanging
- Shows the current **Mid-price**

## üìä New Advanced Market Marketing section

Due to the extreme market volatility in the last 2 weeks, many users have reported losing money due to market swings. In this release, we have made significant improvements to advanced market-making features. We believe that these features will enable users to configure their bots to respond better to market volatility.

See the new [Advanced Market Marketing](/strategies/adv-market-making/) section to learn more about how these features work. We have described the main changes below.

### Inventory skew

We changed the inventory skew algorithm to a better behaved one to limit the user's trading exposure within a defined range. This prevents users from being over-exposed to the risks of a single side of the trade when the market keeps hitting limit orders on one side only.

More information can be found in our documentation for [Inventory Skew](/strategies/inventory-skew/) with sample scenarios.

### Hanging orders

Hanging orders are now tracked as active orders when sending the `status` command. These orders will get canceled after sending the `stop` or `exit` command. Also, users can now specify through `cancel_hanging_order_pct` to cancel hanging orders when their spreads are above a certain value.

Read through [Hanging Orders](/strategies/hanging-orders/) in our documentation for more information.

### Safer defaults

In addition to these advanced features, we also changed the default values of the following parameters to make them safer for new users:

- `cancel_order_wait_time`: now **30** seconds (previously 60 seconds)
- `filled_order_replenish_wait_time`: now **60** seconds (previously 10 seconds)

## üêû Other bug fixes

- Fixed Hummingbot resetting to a command-line screen when errors are shown: [#1519](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1519)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous updates

- Hummingbot Miner now supports Ledger Nano X as well as mobile wallets such as Metamask Mobile, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.
- Minimum order amount validation now applies to the `order_start_size` prompt in multiple order mode
- `start` command no longer cancels and replaces orders if the strategy is already running
