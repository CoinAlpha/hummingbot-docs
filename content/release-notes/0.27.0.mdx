üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.27.0! This release contains a number of new features for advanced users, along with many core stability improvements and bug fixes to the Hummingbot client.

We're also starting to see more external contributions from the Hummingbot community. See [Contributing Guidelines](/developer/contributing/) for more information on how to contribute to Hummingbot.

> **Tip:** "Introducing the Hummingbot Public Roadmap"
In order to communicate the status of bug fixes and planned improvements, we recently began to publish the [Hummingbot Public Roadmap](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/projects/2). We will keep this page updated, so please bookmark this page to see the newest updates to the Hummingbot codebase.

## üîÑ Order Refresh Tolerance

In [#1673](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1673), we introduce a new parameter in the Pure Market Making (PMM) strategy: `order_tolerance_refresh_pct`. This allows you to set an tolerance level for refreshing orders, so that the bot only cancels and replaces orders if the market price has moved by more than a certain threshold.

This feature should help users create more custom bots and manage exchange rate limits better. See [Order Refresh Tolerance](/strategies/order-refresh-tolerance/) for more information.

## üìä Price Band

In [#1713](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1713), we introduce two new parameters in the Pure Market Making (PMM) strategy: `price_ceiling` and `price_floor`. These parameters allow you set a price band within which your bot acts normally, but the bot behaves differently if the market price moves out of the band.

This feature should help users express a view that the market will stay range-bound. See [Price Band](/strategies/price-band/) for more information.

## üêûFixed Memory Leak Bug

We fixed a critical bug [#1683](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1683) that caused the bot to leak memory after users run the `stop` command. This caused the bot to crash unexpectedly after running for a while. This issue is now fixed.

## üêô Kraken Bug Fixes

The Kraken exchange connector, which we released in `v0.26.0`, had a number of bugs. In this release, we have fixed a number of Kraken related bugs, including [#1664](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1664), [#1671](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1671), [#1676](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1676), [#1696](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1696), and [#1693](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1693).

This connector should be much more stable going forward.

## ‚è± LIMIT_MAKER order type in Binance

To fix [#1633](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1633), we now use the `LIMIT_MAKER` order type by default for maker orders on Binance. This order type prevents your bot from making crossed orders that would be taken automatically. This feature should help users set tight spreads more effectively.

## üêû External DB Support

After [#1596](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1596), you can hook up the Hummingbot client to external SQL databases. See [External Database](/operation/adv-command-ref/#advanced-database-configuration) for more information.
