üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.29.0! In this release, we introduce a new feature that allows users to run custom scripts, new advanced pure market making parameter, a new connector and bug fixes.

## ü§ñ New feature: Scripts

The new Scripts feature allows the user to create mini-Python functions that adjust how Hummingbot behaves. For example, users can automate changes to bot params when certain conditions are met. Read more about the scripts feature in the [Scripts](/scripts/script-base/#scriptbase) section in the documentation.

!!! warning
Currently, Scripts can only be used when running Hummingbot from source or with Docker. Using this feature in the Mac or Windows installers will crash the bot.

## üîó New connector: Eterbase

Hummingbot now supports [Eterbase](https://www.eterbase.com/) exchange! Eterbase claims to be the first regulation-compliant European cryptocurrency exchange. Read more about how to use Eterbase connector [here](/exchange-connectors/eterbase/).

## üìä New param: Take Crossed Orders

When using an external price source with pure market making, we added the `take_if_crossed` parameter that allows the strategy to fill the matching maker order when it results in a crossed market.

In certain cases, this behavior may be desirable even if the fee is higher because of the likely future price mitigation.
