üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.30.0!

## üíµ New command: Balance Limit

As described in feature request [#1443](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1443), users can now apply a limit to the total balance to allocate how much the bot can access in an exchange.

This command is useful when running multiple bots sharing the same assets in an account e.g., setting a 50% USDT limit to each bot running BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT pair.

Run the command `balance limit [exchange] [asset] [amount]` to do this. More information in [balance command](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/balances/#gatsby-focus-wrapper).

## üìú New command: Balance Paper

Adding paper trade balances can now be done easier from the Hummingbot client by running `balance paper [asset] [amount]`. Also, users can now check paper trading account balances by running `balance paper` command.

For more information and sample usage, refer to [balance command](/operation/balances/) in our documentation.

## üìñ New command: Order Book

Users can now see the market's order book by running the [order_book](/operation/overview/#hummingbot-commands) command from the Hummingbot CLI while a strategy is running.

By default, this command shows the top 5 bid/ask prices with order volume. It can be used with optional arguments like `--lines` to specify the number of lines to show, `--markets` and `--exchange` if running on cross-exchange and arbitrage strategy.

## üìù Continuously saving trades in CSV file

In the previous versions, users can only see the list of trades in the current session from the `history` command i.e., restarting Hummingbot will start a new list of trades in the new session.

Starting this release, all trades are now continuously saved in a CSV file that can be accessed in the `data` folder.

## üóÑ Improved trades list management in database

We changed how Hummingbot manages trades stored in the local database. This allows users to run multiple bots from the same parent directory without mixing up the list of trades in the history output.

This will also allow running multiple windows of Hummingbot via binary without errors when running the `history` command.
