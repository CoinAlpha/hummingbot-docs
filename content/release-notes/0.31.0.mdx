## üîó New connector: Crypto.com

We are thrilled to announce that we partnered with a leading crypto exchange [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exchange) to integrate Hummingbot‚Äôs trading capabilities and bring liquidity mining to the exchange!

Crypto.com was founded in 2016 on a simple belief: it‚Äôs a basic human right for everyone to control their money, data, and identity. Crypto.com serves over 3 million customers today, providing them with a powerful alternative to traditional financial services through the Crypto.com App, the Crypto.com Card, and the Crypto.com Exchange.

More information in our documentation [here](/spot-connectors/crypto-com/) on how to use the connector.

## üîó Bittrex Connector v3 Update

As Bittrex announced in a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange/status/1273408336214491136), their API v3 is now live. According to Bittrex [v1-1 documentation](https://bittrex.github.io/api/v1-1) the old API v1.1 will be deprecated by September 30, 2020.

In line with this change, we updated our Bittrex connector to make it compatible with v3 API and unit test cases.

## üíª Developers Updates

### Connector Change Summary

In the ongoing effort to make the Hummingbot code base more developer-friendly, we refactored several parts of the exchange connector code to make it easier to add additional exchanges in the future:

- Added a new `ExchangeBase` class to replace `MarketBase`.
- Removed `OrderBookTrackerDataSourceType` and `UserStreamTrackerDataSourceType` from connector.
- Added `_real_time_balance_update` to `ExchangeBase`, set this to `True` if your connector doesn't provide account balance
  update via web socket API, you will also need to set `_in_flight_orders_snapshot` and `_in_flight_orders_snapshot_timestamp`
  during balance update.
- Moved exchange connectors to a new location: [hummingbot/connector/exchange](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/development/hummingbot/connector/exchange)
- Formalize trading pair format, except within the connector module, all trading pairs are in BASE-QUOTE format.
- Remove market argument on `InFlightOrderBase` (it was never used for anything).
