## Introducing the new Liquidity Mining Strategy (Beta)

In v0.36, we the new Liquidity Mining strategy! This strategy helps users who want to participate in Liquidity Mining. The simple strategy with the few parameters that need a value answers the question of “how to set up a liquidity mining bot."

With this new strategy, our users can now quickly start market making on more than one pair, boosting their liquidity mining rewards! We are planning to have more configurable parameters for more advanced users to customize the strategy further. Learn more about it here [2871](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2871).

## External Pricing Source Configuration feature improvement

With this new `price_type` hummingbot will calculate the average cost of your inventory every time a buy order is filled, and all sell orders will be created at `inventory_cost` + `ask_spread`. Learn more here [2513](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2513).

## Loopring connector updated to v3 API in Hummingbot client

In the previous version, Hummingbot used Loopring’s v1 API, which has since been deprecated. With this update, Hummingbot will be using [Loopring’s v3 API](https://docs3.loopring.io/en/). With the updated Loopring connector in this version, any existing API keys used previously in Loopring v1 API will now be invalid. Users must generate new keys from the latest version of the exchange. Learn more about the change here [2885](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2885).

## Perpetual market making improvement

In v0.36, we added a new feature to the perpetual market making strategy. `stop_loss` is now available with the `Profit_taking` and `Trailing_stop` feature.

In the previous version, Hummingbot does not show the correct calculation of PnL and return % when initiating the `history` command. A fix and enhancement were done to show the accurate calculation and output on `total PnL` and `return %` when using the `history` command. You can learn more here [2855](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2855).

## Local history reconciliation with exchange history for Binance

We made some improvements to address network connectivity issues that result in missing trades or duplicate trades being recorded on Hummingbot’s trade history. We have added methods that would:

Pick up trade from API and will trigger OrderFilled if missing in local history.
Will prevent the filing of duplicated orders.

Added improvements on the interaction between connector and TradeFills table in order to check for existing orders. For more information see here [2793](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2793).
