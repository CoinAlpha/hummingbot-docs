## New Exchange Connector: ProBit

In this release, Hummingbot has added more exchanges and is planning to add a lot more exchanges this year! Hummingbot now supports [Probit](https://www.probit.com/) connector. Probit Exchange describes itself as a global coin-to-coin cryptocurrency exchange. ProBit Exchange only lists what it deems to be 'qualified and deserving' cryptocurrency projects. ProBit Exchange reportedly has an order matching speed of over 1.5 million orders per second and a customizable user interface. In addition, ProBit Exchange claims to provide users with the option of a hardware security key in addition to 2 Factor Authentication.

ProBit is compatible with [pure market making](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/), [cross-exchange market-making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/), and [arbitrage strategies](/strategies/arbitrage/).

## Introducing the new Spot Perpetual Arbitrage strategy (Beta)

In v0.37, we introduce the new Spot Perpetual Arbitrage strategy! This strategy lets you arbitrage between a spot and futures exchange. The differences between the prices on the spot and futures markets before the settlement date give a good sense of the direction in which both markets would go. Prices on both futures and spot will converge as the settlement date or time approaches.

The idea of this strategy is to open a position in one direction and execute an order in the opposite direction on the spot.

## Improvement to Liquidity Mining strategy

In v0.37, two new parameters has been added [`max_spread`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#max_spread) and [`max_order_age`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#max_order_age). Tables are also added to let you see more into detail about your balance and also the campaign you've selected.
