## Introducing the new Avellaneda Market Making strategy (Beta)

The new Avellaneda Market Making strategy is designed to maintain inventory ratios between trading pairs given min/max spread restrictions by the user while at the same time maximizing profitability.

This is the first (of many to come!) strategies based on an academic paper aiming to use industry-standard market-making algorithms to achieve the highest profit while keeping control of inventory
It comes in 2 modes:

- Beginner (Where the user leaves algorithm to automate parameters)
- Expert for more technical users who want to try different approaches.

Learn more about the new strategy [here](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/)

## Introducing the new Rate Oracle feature

In this release, we introduce to the users the rate oracle feature. This new feature provides a real-time, most up-to-date exchange rate on any given token or currency from a reliable and trustworthy data source.

If enabled, the bot will use a real-time conversion rate from the oracle when the trading pair symbols mismatch. For example, if markets are set to trade for LINK-USDT and LINK-USDC, the bot will use the oracle conversion rate between USDT and USDC.

Rate Oracle is compatible with [cross-exchange market-making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/), [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage/).

Learn more about the feature [here](/features/rate-oracle/).

## New global configuration: `autofill_import`

The new global configuration lets you choose from `start` and `config` when importing a strategy already created.
