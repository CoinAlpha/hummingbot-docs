This release is a hotfix to version [0.38.0](/release-notes/0.38.0/).

In KuCoin's recent announcement, they are upgrading their API keys to v2.0. To support this change, we upgraded our connector in [#3211](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3211). Hummingbot users can follow [KuCoin API key upgrade operation guide](https://support.kucoin.plus/hc/en-us/articles/900006465403-KuCoin-API-key-upgrade-operation-guide) on how to upgrade API keys.

This version also contains [#3213](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3213) a hotfix for Huobi connector failing to track orders due to invalid API signatures as described in GitHub issue [#3197](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3197).
