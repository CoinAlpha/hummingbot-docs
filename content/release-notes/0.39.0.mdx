Version .40 of Hummingbot, to be releasd in June 2021, will contain the latest development on a strategy for market making on Uniswap using the v3 connector.

## New Feature: Changed Responsibilities for vol_to_spread_multiplier and volatility_sensibility

Hummingbot .39 changes the original `vol_to_spread_multiplier` responsibility for both expanding spread due to volatility and acting as a threshold for parameter recalculation when volatility regime changes.

The new scheme will be:

- `vol_to_spread_multiplier`: min_spread and max_spread will be "inflated" if vol_to_spread_multiplier\*volatility > min_spread

For example: If current volatility is 0.5%, vol*to_spread_multiplier=1.5 and min_spread=0.4%, then min_spread will scaled to min_spread=1.5 * 0.5%=0.75%, also max*spread=original max_spread * 0.75%/0.4%.

- `volatility_sensibility`: Parameter recalculation will be triggered every time current volatility goes beyond volatility_sensibility (%) from the original volatility at the time parameters were initially calculated

For example: If parameters were calculated when volatility=0.5% and volatility_sensibility=20%, if now volatility=0.9% which is greater than 120% of 0.5%=0.7%, then parameter recalculation is triggered.

## New Relative to Start Equity Value feature

The `status` command now displays information about asset values relative to starting equity.

## Coming Exchange Connector: Himalaya

The [Himalaya Exchange](https://www.himalaya.exchange) connector is not yet in use. See [here](/exchange-connectors/Himalaya/) for more information.

The upcoming Himalaya Exchange will support a crypto ecosystem, including the Himalaya Pay app, and the [Himalaya Dollar (HDO)](https://himalaya.exchange/himalaya-dollar).

## Bug Fixes

- [#3235](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3235) Now at the maximum distance from inventory_target, opposing order decays 90% from original amount
- [#3195](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3195) Changed condition to check for "volatility is not NaN" since when volatility=0 although being valid number "bool(volatility) =False" and status message was not showing
- [#3183](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3183) Fixed instances when, while running the avellaneda_mm strategy, you enter the `status` command and the output doesn't show the strategy parameters (risk factor, order_book_depth_factor, volatility and closing time)
- [#3144](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3144) `get_active_markets` in the Kucoin connector was changed to `fetch_active_markets`, because the former had a check that prevented the reading of newly added markets
