## New Exchange Connector: FTX

Hummingbot continues to expand functionality by adding more exchanges. Hummingbot now supports [FTX](https://ftx.com), a cryptocurrency exchange built by traders, for traders. FTX offers industry-first derivatives, options, volatility products and leveraged tokens.

Currently, the FTX connector only supports spot trading, but will be expanded to include perpetuals in the near future.

Read more about how to use the FTX connector [here](/exchange-connectors/ftx/).

## Support for Perpetual Trading on dy/dx

[Dy/dx](https://dydx.exchange/) is a decentralized exchange with over \$6b in all-time trading volume.

The latest version of Hummingbot allows users to connect to dy/dx's [Perpetuals](https://docs.dydx.exchange/#perpetual-contracts), a non-custodial, decentralized margin product offering synthetic exposure to a variety of assets.

## New Uniswap v3 Connector

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) is a decentralized trading protocol guaranteeing liquidity for millions of users and hundreds of Ethereum applications.

Version 3 introduces concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers. Read about Uniswap v3 [here](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/). Consult [Uniswap Documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org) for information about Uniswap v3 Core smart contracts.

Version .39 of the Hummingbot client includes the latest development on a strategy for market making on Uniswap using the v3 connector.

In this strategy, the bot creates two liquidity positions on the Uniswap v3 pool chosen by the trader, a buy and a sell position determined by the price bounds and position spreads. The bot will then monitor the price, automatically swap tokens and replace positions accordingly.

## New Relative to Start Equity Value feature

The `status` command now displays information about asset values relative to starting equity.

## Aggregate Data Collection Restricted

Data collection in v0.39 is reduced to exchange and volume, denominated in USD.

## Coming Exchange Connector: Himalaya

The [Himalaya Exchange](https://www.himalaya.exchange) connector is not yet in use. See [here](/exchange-connectors/Himalaya/) for more information.

The upcoming Himalaya Exchange will support a crypto ecosystem, including the Himalaya Pay app, and the [Himalaya Dollar (HDO)](https://himalaya.exchange/himalaya-dollar).

## Bug Fixes

- [#3235](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3235) Now at the maximum distance from inventory_target, opposing order decays 90% from original amount
- [#3218] (https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3218/commits) Fixes a bug where `max spread` limits would expand when volatility was high, but paramaters were still being calculated using original spreads.
