## New Exchange Connector: FTX

Hummingbot continues to expand functionality by adding more exchanges. Hummingbot now supports [FTX](https://ftx.com), a cryptocurrency exchange built by traders, for traders. FTX offers industry-first derivatives, options, volatility products and leveraged tokens.

Currently, the FTX connector only supports spot trading, but will be expanded to include perpetuals in an upcoming release.

Read more about how to use the FTX connector [here](/exchange-connectors/ftx/).

## Support for Perpetual Trading on dy/dx

[Dy/dx](https://dydx.exchange/) is a full-featured decentralized exchange with over \$6b in all-time trading volume. It is built on Ethereum, and claims to offer one of the most liquid order books across decentralized exchanges.

## Coming Soon: Uniswap v3 Connector

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) is a decentralized trading protocol guaranteeing liquidity for millions of users and hundreds of Ethereum applications.

Version 3 introduces concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers. Read about Uniswap v3 [here](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/). Consult [Uniswap Documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org) for information about Uniswap v3 Core smart contracts.

Version .40 of Hummingbot, to be releasd in June 2021, will contain the latest development on a strategy for market making on Uniswap using the v3 connector.

## New Feature: Changed Responsibilities for vol_to_spread_multiplier and volatility_sensibility

Hummingbot .39 changes the original `vol_to_spread_multiplier` responsibility for both expanding spread due to volatility and acting as a threshold for parameter recalculation when volatility regime changes.

The new scheme will be:

- `vol_to_spread_multiplier`: min_spread and max_spread will be "inflated" if vol_to_spread_multiplier\*volatility > min_spread

For example: If current volatility is 0.5%, vol*to_spread_multiplier=1.5 and min_spread=0.4%, then min_spread will scaled to min_spread=1.5 * 0.5%=0.75%, also max*spread=original max_spread * 0.75%/0.4%.

- `volatility_sensibility`: Parameter recalculation will be triggered every time current volatility goes beyond volatility_sensibility (%) from the original volatility at the time parameters were initially calculated

For example: If parameters were calculated when volatility=0.5% and volatility_sensibility=20%, if now volatility=0.9% which is greater than 120% of 0.5%=0.7%, then parameter recalculation is triggered.

## New Relative to Start Equity Value feature

The `status` command now displays information about asset values relative to starting equity.

## Coming Exchange Connector: Himalaya

The [Himalaya Exchange](https://www.himalaya.exchange) connector is not yet in use. See [here](/exchange-connectors/Himalaya/) for more information.

The upcoming Himalaya Exchange will support a crypto ecosystem, including the Himalaya Pay app, and the [Himalaya Dollar (HDO)](https://himalaya.exchange/himalaya-dollar).

## Bug Fixes

- [#3235](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3235) Now at the maximum distance from inventory_target, opposing order decays 90% from original amount
- [#3195](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3195) Changed condition to check for "volatility is not NaN" since when volatility=0 although being valid number "bool(volatility) =False" and status message was not showing
- [#3183](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3183) Fixed instances when, while running the avellaneda_mm strategy, you enter the `status` command and the output doesn't show the strategy parameters (risk factor, order_book_depth_factor, volatility and closing time)
- [#3144](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/3144) `get_active_markets` in the Kucoin connector was changed to `fetch_active_markets`, because the former had a check that prevented the reading of newly added markets
