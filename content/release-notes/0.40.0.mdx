## 🌎 Additional Features : Rate Oracle now in AMM - Arbitrage!

## ⭐ New Strategy Features with Avellaneda Market-Making

### `order_levels`

- A new strategy command that can be initiated when `parameters_based_on_spread = true`.
- The order size of the level will be equal to `order_amount` the spread between the orders will be calculated based on the `max_spread`, and the new orders related to order levels will be created between the first order and `max_spread`, distributed exponentially.
- When `parameters_based_on_spread` = false, the behaviour of `order_levels` will be similar to `pure_market_making`

### `order_override`

If you prefer manual control of orders rather than bot calculated `order_amount` and `order_level_parameter`, manually set order value of buy/sell, order spread, and order amount with [`order_override`](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/#order_override).

**You can only set the `order_override` in the strategy config file you created.**
