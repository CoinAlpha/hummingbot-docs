## New Strategy Feature : Hanging Orders

To activate this advanced feature, users must configure their saved Avellaneda Strategy Config File.

Enable `hanging_orders_enabled = false` with `hanging_orders_enabled = true`.

You can also set your Aggregation Type in the computation of your hanging orders `hanging_orders_aggregation-type`.

- default = no_aggregation
- volume_weighted
- volume_time_weighted
- volume_distance_weighted

Lastly, you can now cancel hanging orders by indicating mid price spread in percentage.

`hanging_orders_cancel_pct = (Enter 1 to indicate 1%)`

**Learn more in this [documentation](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making).**
