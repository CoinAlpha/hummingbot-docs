## New Spot Connector : Gate.io

[Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/) is operated by Gate Technology Corp. Their mission is to serve the blockchain industry by providing secure and reliable products & services to consumers and companies around the world.

The "Gate ecosystem" consists of Gate.io, Wallet.io, HipoDeFi and Gatechain, all of which were created to provide users with a secure, simple and fair trading platform as well as the ability to safeguard assets and trading information.

Read more in our documentation: [How to use Gate.io connector](/spot-connectors/gate-io).

## New Strategy : TWAP

We took our existing TWAP strategy (Time-weighted Average Price) from the development branch into production to be used in the latest version. This strategy allows users to create either buy or sell orders continuously at a specified time interval in between orders.

For more information, you may read through our [TWAP strategy documentation](/strategies/twap).

## New Avellaneda Market Making Feature : Hanging Orders

The hanging orders feature that was previously available only in Pure Market Making strategy, is now added to Avellaneda Market Making.

## New Rate Oracle Sources : KuCoin and AscendEX

There were reported issues where some assets are not showing their equivalent USD value as described in [#3136](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3136). This is because previously, Hummingbot can only use Binance and CoinGecko as sources i.e. if the asset is not listed in any of those two, it cannot be converted.

Starting this release, users can now select KuCoin and AscendEX from the list of options as the source. This will also help liquidity mining participants who are trading on the said exchanges when checking their balances.

Run `config rate_oracle_source` in Hummingbot to change this setting.

<Callout

  body="Currently, USD (default) global token does not work with Kucoin and Ascendex, you may need to change your `global_token` to USDT."

## Uniswap v3 LP Improvements

As part of improving the Uniswap v3 LP strategy, we added a profitability calculation to show the performance of open positions in the `status` command output. A notification in the logs will also show volatility parameters.

In this release, we will continue testing the strategy and get feedback from users for the subsequent iterations.

## Other Enhancements

- [#3097](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/3097) Timestamps are now included in the notifications when a buy or sell order is filled. **We want to thank our community member [willzs03](https://github.com/willzs03) for the initial contribution! üôè**
