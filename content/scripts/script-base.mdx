## ScriptBase

This is the base class (`hummingbot/script/script_base.py`) for your script. It provides data, events, and functions
as below.

### Data

At every tick, the script gets the current market price (`mid_price`), strategy configuration (`pmm_parameters`), and
total balances (`all_total_balances`). The `mid_price` is stored in a list (`mid_prices`) where a new `mid_price`
is added to the end of the list, whereas strategy configuration and total balances are replaced every time.

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="The current script feature supports only pure_market_making strategy configuration."
/>

### pmm_parameters

Setting a pure market making strategy parameter to a new value assigns a new value to it.

Usage Example: `self.pmm_parameters.bid_spread = Decimal("0.03")` - to update bid spread to 3%

These below are configurable parameters:

- buy_levels (a number of buy orders to place, initially set to `order_levels` when the strategy starts)
- sell_levels (a number of sell orders to place, initially set to `order_levels` when the strategy starts)
- order_levels
- bid_spread
- ask_spread
- order_amount
- order_level_spread
- order_level_amount
- order_refresh_time
- order_refresh_tolerance_pct
- filled_order_delay
- hanging_orders_enabled
- hanging_orders_cancel_pct

### Events

- **on_tick**

  The code here will be executed on every tick, which is every second on a default Hummingbot configuration.

- **on_buy_order_completed**

  The script will be notified every time a buy order of yours is fully filled. Put in your code logic here to handle such
  situation if needed.

- **on_sell_order_completed**

  The script will be notified every time a sell order of yours is fully filled. Put in your code logic here to handle such
  situation if needed.

- **on_status**

  This is called upon the `status` command issued on the Hummingbot application. You can provide your custom status message
  here.

### Functions

- **notify**

  Notifies the user, the message will appear on the top left panel of HB application.
  If Telegram integration is enabled, the message will also be sent to the telegram user.

  Usage Example: `self.notify("Hello world")`

- **log**

  Logs message to the strategy log file and display it on the Running Logs section of HB.

  Usage Example: `self.log("Hello world")`

- **avg_mid_price**

  Calculates average (mean) of the stored mid prices.

  Usage Example: `avg_value = self.avg_mid_price(60, 30)` - to calculate average mid price at a minute interval for the
  last 30 minutes

- **avg_price_volatility**

  Calculates average (mean) price volatility. Volatility is a price change compared to the previous cycle regardless of its direction, e.g., if the price changes -3% (or 3%), the volatility is 3%.

  Usage Example: `avg_value = self.avg_price_volatility(60, 30)` - to calculate average price volatility at a minute
  interval for the last 30 minutes

- **median_price_volatility**

  Calculates median (middle value) price volatility.

  Usage Example: `median_value = self.median_price_volatility(60, 30)` - to calculate median price volatility at
  a minute interval for the last 30 minutes

- **locate_central_price_volatility**

  Calculates central located price volatility based on a given mean function. The mean function can be one
  that is supported by the `statistics` library, e.g., mean, median, geometric_mean, and many more.

  Usage Example: `median_value = self.locate_central_price_volatility(60, 30, median)` - to calculate median price
  volatility at a minute interval for the last 30 minutes

- **round_by_step**

  Rounds a given number down by a given step size.

  Usage Example: `rounded_value = self.round_by_step(1.8, 0.25)` will give you 1.75

- **take_samples**

  Takes samples out of a given list where the last item is the most recent.
  Example List `a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

  Usage Example: `samples = self.take_samples(a_list, 3, 2)` will give you `[4, 7]`
