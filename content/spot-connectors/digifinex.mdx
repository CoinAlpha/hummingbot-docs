## Using the Connector

To use [Digifinex](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/login) connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your digifinex API key >>>
Enter your digifinex secret API key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

Make sure you store your Secret Key somewhere secure and do not share it with anyone. Your Secret Key will only be displayed once at the time when you create the API.

  body="If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API."

## Miscellaneous Info

Users may experience WebSocket errors, and timeout may occur every 2 hours. In addition, there is a known server-side issue with regards to their rate limit, where users might be prematurely banned for exceeding rate limits.

### Minimum order sizes

Minimum order size varies per market. All minimum trade quantities can be found in the following public API:

```
https://openapi.digifinex.com/v3/markets
```

Refer to the API response below as an example:

```
{
    "data":
    [
      {
        "volume_precision":8,
        "price_precision":2,
        "market":"btc_usdt",
        "min_amount":2,
        "min_volume":5e-05
      },
      ...
    ]
},
```

You should focus on the data fields `min_volume`, which refers to the minimum order size based on base asset, and `min_amount`, which is based on quote asset.

### Transaction Fees

The transaction fee for the Spot transaction is 0.2% per time. DFT holders can enjoy the discount. Become a VIP user and enjoy a lower transaction fee, with a minimum fee of 0.060%
