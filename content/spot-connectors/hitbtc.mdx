HitBTC is a leading European bitcoin exchange that provides cryptocurrency trading services to institutional, merchants, and individual traders worldwide. The trading platform was founded in late 2013 and is under the operation of Ullus Corporation.

## Using the Connector

To use [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/) connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your hitbtc API key >>>
Enter your hitbtc secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

5. Now that you have created an API key, connect it to Hummingbot using the `connect` command.

Make sure you store your Secret Key somewhere secure and do not share it with anyone. Your Secret Key will only be displayed once at the time when you create the API.

  body="If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API."
