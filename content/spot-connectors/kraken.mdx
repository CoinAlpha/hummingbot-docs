Kraken is a centralized exchange based in San Francisco, CA, founded in 2011. Users can trade several cryptocurrencies and various fiat currencies such as USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, CHF, and JPY.

It was the first bitcoin exchange to display its market data on the [Bloomberg Terminal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bloomberg_terminal.asp), the first to pass a cryptographically verifiable proof-of-reserves audit, and one of the first exchanges to offer leveraged bitcoin margin trading.

## Using the Connector

Because [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API keys to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Kraken API key >>>
Enter your Kraken secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

### Asset Codes

Kraken uses asset codes in front of some pairs as a classification system. Asset codes starting with **'X'** represent cryptocurrencies, though this is no longer followed for the newest coins. Asset codes starting with **'Z'** represent fiat currencies.

BTC is represented as XBT in this exchange. Therefore trading on this pair is viewed as XXBT, e.g., XXBT-USDT. However, Hummingbot uses symbol conversion so that it will be entered as `BTC-USDT`. For e.g.
