## What are Connectors?

Connectors are packages of code that link Hummingbot's internal trading algorithms with live information from different cryptocurrency exchanges. They interact with a given exchange's API, such as by gathering order book data and sending and cancelling trades.

## How connectors are integrated into Hummingbot?

Connectors are packages of code that link Hummingbot's internal trading algorithms with live information from different cryptocurrency exchanges. They interact with a given exchange's API, such as by gathering order book data and sending and canceling trades.

Generally, there are two ways of getting connectors integrated into Hummingbot:

1. Exchanges or protocols contact the Hummingbot team to write/build the connector, merge it into our codebase, and ship it out during a release. Some examples of these connectors are [Binance.com](https://www.binance.com/en), [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Terra](https://www.terra.money/)

2. Connectors that start life as a fork or pre-built [pull request](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pulls) that goes through the [governance process](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-08-exchange-connector-governance/) - we let the community vote for the next exchange connector that we integrate into Hummingbot. Some examples are [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) and [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/)

If you are affiliated with the exchange and would like to discuss building and/or integrating a connector into Hummingbot, please send an email to partnerships@hummingbot.io
