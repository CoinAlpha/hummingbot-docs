## Using the Connector

To use [ProBit KR](https://www.probit.kr) connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your ProBit KR Client ID >>>
Enter your ProBit KR secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.
