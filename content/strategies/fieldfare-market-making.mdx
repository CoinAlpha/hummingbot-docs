## How it Works

The Fieldfare Market Making Strategy is designed to scale inventory and keep it at a certain target that a user defines it to. To do so, strategy will optimize both bid and ask spreads and their order amount to maximize profitability.

In its beginner mode, user will be questioned of min and max spread limits and it's aversion to inventory risk scaled from 0 to 1 (Being 0 more driven to profit but less to inventory in target, and 1 being driven to keep tight control of inventory at the expense of less profit). Additionally, sensitivity to volatility changes will be included with a special parameter `vol_to_spread_multiplier`, to modify spreads in scenarios of big volatility.

In expert mode, user will need to define directly the basic parameters of the algorithm described in the foundation paper (reference to Avellaneda paper) and no recalculation of parameters will happen.

## Prerequisites

### Inventory

You will need to hold sufficient inventory of quote and/or base currencies on the exchange to place orders of the exchange's minimum order size.

### Minimum Order Size

When placing orders, if the size of the order determined by the order price and quantity is below the exchange's minimum order size, then the orders will not be created.

## Basic Parameters

We aim to teach new users the basics of market making, while enabling experienced users to exercise more control over how their bots behave. By default, when you run `create` we ask you to enter the basic parameters needed for a market making bot.

### `exchange`

The exchange where the bot will place bid and ask orders.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt prompt="Enter your maker spot connector" response=">>> binance" />

### `market`

Token trading pair symbol you would like to trade on the exchange.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the token trading pair you would like to trade on the exchange"
  response=">>> BTC-USDT"
/>

### `order_amount`

The order amount for the limit bid and ask orders. Ensure you have enough quote and base tokens to place the bid and ask orders. The strategy will not place any orders if you do not have sufficient balance on either sides of the order. <br/>

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="What is the amount of [base_asset] per order? (minimum [min_amount])"
  response=""
/>

### `order_optimization_enabled`

Allows your bid and ask order prices to be adjusted based on the current top bid and ask prices in the market.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Do you want to automate Avellaneda-Stoikov parameters based on min/max spread?"
  response="True"
/>

### `min_spread`

The minimum spread related to the mid price allowed by user for bid/ask orders

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the minimum spread allowed from mid-price in percentage (Enter 1 to indicate 1%)"
  response=""
/>

### `max_spread`

The maximum spread related to the mid price allowed by user for bid/ask orders

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the maximum spread allowed from mid-price in percentage (Enter 1 to indicate 1%)"
  response=""
/>

### `vol_to_spread_multiplier`

`vol_to_spread_multiplier` will act as a threshold value to override max_spread when volatility is a higher value
For a multiplier of 1 if volatility is bigger than max_spread, then max_spread will be 1*volatility
For a multiplier of 2, if volatility is 50% or more of max_spread then max_spread will be replaced by 2*volatility
For a multiplier of 3, if volatility is 33% or more of max_spread then max_spread will be replaced by 3\*volatility

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the Volatility threshold multiplier: (If market volatility multiplied by this value is above maximum spread, it will increase the maximum spread value)"
  response=""
/>

### `inventory_risk_aversion`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter Inventory risk aversion between 0 and 1: (For values close to 0.999 spreads will be more skewed to meet the inventory target, while close to 0.001 spreads will be close to symmetrical, increasing profitability but also increasing inventory risk)"
  response=""
/>

### `order_refresh_time`

An amount in seconds, which is the duration for the placed limit orders. The limit bid and ask orders are cancelled and new orders are placed according to the current mid price and spreads at this interval.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="How often do you want to cancel and replace bids and asks (in seconds)?"
  response=""
/>

### `inventory_target_base_pct`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="What is your inventory target for base asset? Enter 50 for 50%?"
  response="50"
/>

## Advanced Parameters

These are additional parameters that you can reconfigure and use to customize the behavior of your strategy further. To change its settings, run the command `config` followed by the parameter name e.g. `config max_order_age`.

### `order_book_depth_factor`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt prompt="Enter order book depth factor (k)" response=">>>" />

### `risk_factor`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt prompt="Enter risk factor (y)" response=">>>" />

### `order_amount_shape_factor`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt prompt="Enter order amount shape factor (n)" response=">>>" />

### `closing_time`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter operational closing time (T). (How long will each trading cycle last in days or fractions of day)"
  response=">>>"
/>

### `max_order_age`

The `max_order_age` parameter allows you to set a specific duration when to reset your order's age. It refreshes your orders and automatically creates an order based on the spread and movement of the market.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="How long do you want to cancel and replace bids and asks with the same price (in seconds)?"
  response=">>>"
/>

### `order_refresh_tolerance_pct`

The spread (from mid price) to defer order refresh process to the next cycle.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the percent change in price needed to refresh orders at each cycle"
  response=">>> 1"
/>

### `filled_order_delay`

How long to wait before placing the next set of orders in case at least one of your orders gets filled.

For example, with a filled_order_delay = 300 when an order created by the bot is filled, the next pair of orders will only be created 300 seconds later.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="How long do you want to wait before placing the next order if your order gets filled (in seconds)?"
  response=">>>"
/>

### `add_transaction_costs`

Whether to enable adding transaction costs to order price calculation.

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Do you want to add transaction costs automatically to order prices? (Yes/No)"
  response=">>>"
/>

### `volatility_buffer_size`

** Prompt: **

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter amount of ticks that will be stored to calculate volatility"
  response=">>>"
/>
