## How it works

The liquidity mining strategy allows users to run market making bots on markets that are yielding liquidity mining rewards. This strategy offers diversification by running a market making strategy across different campaigns. It also provides better capital allocation by sizing orders based on target based allocation.

This strategy also provides easy setup and maintenance. Another key unique feature is dynamic spread adjustment on market volatility.

This strategy has parameters like [`volatility_interval`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#volatility_interval) and [`avg_volatility_spread`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#avg_volatility_period) that automatically adjust the spreads based on a market’s volatility based on the historical mid-price.

Market volatility is calculated using ATR (Average True Range) of historical mid price. The true range is a difference between the max and min mid price value of the period expressed in percentage value, i.e. (`max_mid_price` - `min_mid_price`)/`min_mid_price`)

The volatility is translated to spread by multiplying it to `volatility_to_spread_multiplier` (volatility \* `volatility_to_spread_multiplier`).

You can see the ongoing campaigns [here](https://docs.hummingbot.io/miner/liquidity-mining/current-rewards&terms/).

## Pre-requisites

Inventory

You will need to hold a sufficient inventory of quote and base currencies to place orders of the exchange's minimum order size.

Minimum order size

When placing orders, if the order's size determined by the order price and quantity is below the exchange's minimum order size, orders will not be created.

## Basic Parameters

The following walks through all the steps when running the `create` command.

### `exchange`

The exchange where the bot will create and place orders.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter your liquidity mining exchange name? "
  response=">>> Binance"
/>

### `markets`

Token trading pair symbols you would like to trade on the exchange.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter a list of markets (comma separated, e.g. LTC-USDT,ETH-USDT) "
  response=">>> ETH-USDT"
/>

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="If participating in multiple markets, this strategy only supports trading pairs that share the same base or quote asset."
/>

### `token`

Choose between the base and quote asset wherein you want to provide liquidity. After running `start` command the user's balance of `token` is split between all eligible liquidity mining markets on the selected exchange.

<Prompt
  prompt="What asset (base or quote) do you want to use to provide liquidity? "
  response=">>> ETH"
/>

### `order_amount`

The order amount for the limit bid and ask orders. Ensure you have enough balance on base and quote tokens to place the bid and ask orders.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is the size of each order (in ETH amount)? "
  response=">>> 0.008"
/>

### `spread`

The strategy will place the order on a certain % away from the current mid-price. Spreads are automatically adjusted based on the [`volatility_interval`](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/liquidity-mining/#volatility_interval).

<Prompt
  prompt="How far away from the mid price do you want to place bid and ask orders? (Enter 1 to indicate 1%) "
  response=">>> 1"
/>

### `target_base_pct`

It sets a target of base asset balance in relation to a total asset allocation value (in percentage value). It works the same as the pure market making strategy's [`inventory_skew`](/strategies/inventory-skew/) feature in order to achieve this target.

<Prompt
  prompt="For each pair, what is your target base asset percentage? (Enter 20 to indicate 20%) "
  response=">>> 20"
/>

## Advanced Parameters

These are additional parameters that you can reconfigure and use to further customize the behavior of your strategy. To change its settings, run the command `config` followed by the parameter name e.g. `config volatility_interval`.

See [this page](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/command-ref/#config) for more information how to use `config` command.

### `order_refresh_time`

Value in seconds of the orders’ duration before canceling and creating new sets of orders depending on the current mid-price and spreads at the interval. The default value for the parameter is 10s.

<Prompt
  prompt="How often do you want to cancel and replace bids and asks (in seconds)? "
  response=">>> 10"
/>

### `order_refresh_tolerance_pct`

Determines the tolerance threshold in the percentage of the order price before replacing the orders. This is to prevent replacing the orders too often. The parameter has a default value of 0.02%.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the percent change in price needed to refresh orders at each cycle (Enter 1 to indicate 1%) "
  response=">>> 0.02"
/>

### `inventory_range_multiplier`

This parameter expands the range of tolerable inventory levels on your target base percent as a multiple of your total order size. Larger values expand this range. The predefined value is 1.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is your tolerable range of inventory around the target, expressed in multiples of your total order size?"
  response=">>> 1"
/>

### `volatility_interval`

The interval, in seconds, in which to pick historical data from mid-price to calculate market volatility. The predefined value is 300s.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is an interval, in second, in which to pick historical mid price data from to calculate market volatility? "
  response=">>> 300"
/>

### `avg_volatility_period`

The number of intervals based on `volatility_interval` to calculate the average market volatility. The predefined value is 10.

<Prompt
  prompt="How many interval does it take to calculate average market volatility? "
  response=">>> 10"
/>

### `volatility_to_spread_multiplier`

This expands the average spread depending on the value set. The predefined value is 1.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter a multiplier used to convert average volatility to spread (enter 1 for 1 to 1 conversion) "
  response=">>> 1"
/>

## Sample Configurations

Here's an example of how the liquidity mining strategy works.

```json
exchange: binance
markets: AVAX-USDT,AVAX-BNB,AVAX-BTC
token: AVAX
order_amount: 0.4
spread: 1%
target_base_pct: 50%
order_refresh_time: 10
order_refresh_tolerance_pct: 0.2
inventory_range_multiplier: 1.0
volatility_interval: 20
avg_volatility_period: 2
volatility_to_spread_multiplier: 1.0
```

This strategy lets you run multiple token pairs in one bot. The bot distributes the `token` balance in order to create 3 orders on both bid and ask. Make sure that your orders meet the minimum order size of the exchange in order for it to create orders on all pairs.

These values will show after running `status` command. `Exchange`, `Market`, `Mid Price`, `Volatility`, `Base Bal`, `Quote Bal` and `Base %`.

**`Exchange`**

Refers to the exchange chosen.

**`Market`**

This shows the markets that you have entered to provide liquidity STRAX-BTC and SCRT-BTC as shown in the example above.

**`Mid price`**

The average of best bid and best ask price in the orderbook.

**`Volatility`**

The adjustment in volatility will apply to your current spread at order refresh time if the value of volatility is higher than your spread.

**`Base Bal`**

This shows the base balance that you currently have.

**`Quote Bal`**

This shows the quote balance that you currently have.

**`Base %`**

The allocation of your base asset vs the quote asset. Set `target_base_pct` to your desired target base asset portion of quote asset allocation in percentage value. The bot will try to achieve this ratio by adjusting order amount placed in each of your order.

The bot will calculate the volatility based on the interval set in this case it's 20s. Then the `avg_volatility_period` will calculate the intervals and replace the spread if the value is higher than the current spread. The new spread also depends on the `volatility_to_spread_multiplier` in this case is set to 1.

![](/img/volatility_interval.png)

The spread for AVAX-USDT was widened in the image below because the volatility % was higher than the spread that was set because of the dynamic spread adjustment on market volatility.
