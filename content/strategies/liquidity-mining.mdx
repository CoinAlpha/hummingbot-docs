## How it works

The liquidity mining strategy allows users to run a single strategy and earn rewards in multiple Liquidity Mining campaigns. This strategy helps users who want to participate in liquidity mining but doesn’t want to configure a bot with the pure market making strategy.

This strategy has parameters like [`volatility_interval`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#volatility_interval) and [`avg_volatility_spread`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#avg_volatility_period) that automatically adjust the spreads based on a market’s volatility based on the historical mid-price.

## Pre-requisites

### Inventory

You will need to hold a sufficient inventory of quote and base currencies to place orders of the exchange's minimum order size.

### Minimum order size

When placing orders, if the order's size determined by the order price and quantity is below the exchange's minimum order size, orders will not be created.

## Basic Parameters

The following walks through all the steps when running `create` command.

### `exchange`

The exchange where the bot will create and place orders.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter your liquidity mining exchange name? "
  response=">>> Binance"
/>

### `markets`

Token trading pair symbols you would like to trade on the exchange.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter a list of markets (comma separated, e.g. LTC-USDT,ETH-USDT) "
  response=">>> ETH-USDT"
/>

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="If participating in multiple markets, use the same base or quote asset. Different pairs without the same base or quote are not available at the same time"
/>

### `token`

Choose between the base and quote asset wanted to use to provide liquidity. When participating in liquidity mining, use the quote asset.

<Prompt
  prompt="What asset (base or quote) do you want to use to provide liquidity? "
  response=">>> ETH"
/>

### `order_amount`

The order amount for the limit bid and ask orders. Ensure you have enough balance on base and quote tokens to place the bid and ask orders.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is the size of each order (in ETH amount)? "
  response=">>> 0.008"
/>

### `spread`

The strategy will place the order on a certain % away from the current mid-price. Spreads are automatically adjusted based on the [`volatility_interval`](link).

<Prompt
  prompt="How far away from the mid price do you want to place bid and ask orders? (Enter 1 to indicate 1%) "
  response=">>> 1"
/>

### `target_base_pct`

This parameter determines for each pair the value in % for the base asset. If you set it at a certain lower value than the base %, it will only create sell orders depending on your balance.

<Prompt
  prompt="For each pair, what is your target base asset percentage? (Enter 20 to indicate 20%) "
  response=">>> 20"
/>

### `order_refresh_time`

Value in seconds of the orders’ duration before canceling and creating new sets of orders depending on the current mid-price and spreads at the interval. The default value for the parameter is 10s.

<Prompt
  prompt="How often do you want to cancel and replace bids and asks (in seconds)? "
  response=">>> 10"
/>

### `order_refresh_tolerance_pct`

The spread (from mid-price) to defer the order refresh process to the next cycle. The parameter has a default value of 0.02%.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the percent change in price needed to refresh orders at each cycle (Enter 1 to indicate 1%) "
  response=">>> 0.02"
/>

### `inventory_range_multiplier`

This parameter expands the range of tolerable inventory levels on your target base percent as a multiple of your total order size. Larger values expand this range. The predefined value is 1.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is your tolerable range of inventory around the target, expressed in multiples of your total order size?"
  response=">>> 1"
/>

## Advanced Parameters

### `volatility_interval`

The interval, in seconds, in which to pick historical data from mid-price to calculate market volatility. The predefined value is 300s.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is an interval, in second, in which to pick historical mid price data from to calculate market volatility? "
  response=">>> 300"
/>

### `avg_volatility_period`

The number of intervals based on `volatility_interval` to calculate the average market volatility. The predefined value is 10.

<Prompt
  prompt="How many interval does it take to calculate average market volatility? "
  response=">>> 10"
/>

### `volatility_to_spread_multiplier`

The multiplier used to convert average volatility to spread (`avg_volatility_period` x `volatility_to_spread_multiplier`). The predefined value is 10.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter a multiplier used to convert average volatility to spread (enter 1 for 1 to 1 conversion) "
  response=">>> 1"
/>
