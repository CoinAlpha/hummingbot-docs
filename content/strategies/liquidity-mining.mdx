## How it works

The liquidity mining strategy allows users to run market making bots on markets that are yielding liquidity mining rewards. This strategy offers diversification by running a market making strategy across different campaigns. It also provides better capital allocation by sizing orders based on target based allocation.

This strategy also provides easy setup and maintenance. Another key unique feature is dynamic spread adjustment on market volatility.
This strategy has parameters like [`volatility_interval`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#volatility_interval) and [`avg_volatility_spread`](/strategies/liquidity-mining/#avg_volatility_period) that automatically adjust the spreads based on a market’s volatility based on the historical mid-price.

## Pre-requisites

### Inventory

You will need to hold a sufficient inventory of quote and base currencies to place orders of the exchange's minimum order size.

### Minimum order size

When placing orders, if the order's size determined by the order price and quantity is below the exchange's minimum order size, orders will not be created.

## Basic Parameters

The following walks through all the steps when running `create` command.

### `exchange`

The exchange where the bot will create and place orders.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter your liquidity mining exchange name? "
  response=">>> Binance"
/>

### `markets`

Token trading pair symbols you would like to trade on the exchange.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter a list of markets (comma separated, e.g. LTC-USDT,ETH-USDT) "
  response=">>> ETH-USDT"
/>

<Callout
  type="note"
  body="If participating in multiple markets, use the same base or quote asset. Different pairs without the same base or quote are not available at the same time"
/>

### `token`

Choose between the base and quote asset wherein you want to provide liquidity.

<Prompt
  prompt="What asset (base or quote) do you want to use to provide liquidity? "
  response=">>> ETH"
/>

### `order_amount`

The order amount for the limit bid and ask orders. Ensure you have enough balance on base and quote tokens to place the bid and ask orders.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is the size of each order (in ETH amount)? "
  response=">>> 0.008"
/>

### `spread`

The strategy will place the order on a certain % away from the current mid-price. Spreads are automatically adjusted based on the [`volatility_interval`](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/liquidity-mining/#volatility_interval).

<Prompt
  prompt="How far away from the mid price do you want to place bid and ask orders? (Enter 1 to indicate 1%) "
  response=">>> 1"
/>

### `target_base_pct`

It sets a target of base asset balance in relation to a total asset allocation value (in percentage value). The bot will then try to achieve this target by utilizing the `inventory_skew `feature.

<Prompt
  prompt="For each pair, what is your target base asset percentage? (Enter 20 to indicate 20%) "
  response=">>> 20"
/>

### `order_refresh_time`

Value in seconds of the orders’ duration before canceling and creating new sets of orders depending on the current mid-price and spreads at the interval. The default value for the parameter is 10s.

<Prompt
  prompt="How often do you want to cancel and replace bids and asks (in seconds)? "
  response=">>> 10"
/>

### `order_refresh_tolerance_pct`

Determines the tolerance threshold in percentage of the order price before replacing the orders. This is to prevent replacing the orders too often. The parameter has a default value of 0.02%.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter the percent change in price needed to refresh orders at each cycle (Enter 1 to indicate 1%) "
  response=">>> 0.02"
/>

### `inventory_range_multiplier`

This parameter expands the range of tolerable inventory levels on your target base percent as a multiple of your total order size. Larger values expand this range. The predefined value is 1.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is your tolerable range of inventory around the target, expressed in multiples of your total order size?"
  response=">>> 1"
/>

## Advanced Parameters

### `volatility_interval`

The interval, in seconds, in which to pick historical data from mid-price to calculate market volatility. The predefined value is 300s.

<Prompt
  prompt="What is an interval, in second, in which to pick historical mid price data from to calculate market volatility? "
  response=">>> 300"
/>

### `avg_volatility_period`

The number of intervals based on `volatility_interval` to calculate the average market volatility. The predefined value is 10.

<Prompt
  prompt="How many interval does it take to calculate average market volatility? "
  response=">>> 10"
/>

### `volatility_to_spread_multiplier`

This expands the average spread depending on the value set. The predefined value is 1.

<Prompt
  prompt="Enter a multiplier used to convert average volatility to spread (enter 1 for 1 to 1 conversion) "
  response=">>> 1"
/>
