title: Max Order Age
---

This parameter allows you to set the maximum age of an order. When an order exceeds this age, it is automatically refreshed with the price and amount depending on the movement of the market. It cannot be set to 0 or a negative value.

## How it works

By default the parameter is set to 1800 seconds.

To reconfigure, run the command `config max_order_age` and set the desired value in seconds.

The `max_order_age` parameter allows you to set a specific duration when to reset your orders age. It refreshes your orders and automatically creates an order based on the spread and movement of the market also hanging orders still remain as hanging orders.

## Sample configuration

We can set the the maximum age of an order before it refreshes back to the set spread and amount. The example below shows we refreshed the the order's age before `order_refresh_time` was triggered because of `max_order_age` that is set to 20 seconds.

```json
bid_spread : 0.50
ask_spread : 0.50
max_order_age : 20.0
order_refresh_time : 60.0
```

### Max order age with order refresh tolerance

Setting our `max_order_age` at a lower time than `order_refresh_time` refreshes our orders based on the last spread and value.

Now try out a configuration without max order age and let’s enable order refresh tolerance.

```json
bid_spread : 0.50
ask_spread : 0.50
order_refresh_tolerance_pct: 0.1
order_refresh_time : 60.0
```

The orders are not cancelling because it is within the 0.1% order refresh tolerance percentage even though the order refresh time is at 30 seconds.

Now add max order age to the config.

```json
bid_spread : 0.50
ask_spread : 0.50
order_refresh_tolerance_pct: 0.02
max_order_age: 15.0
order_refresh_time : 30.0
```

The `max_order_age` parameter tried to refresh the order but `order_refresh_tolerance_pct` kicked in that’s why the order was cancelled and the bot created a new order because it reached the threshold of 0.02%.

### Max order age with hanging orders

Max order age respects hanging orders and refreshes the orders but does not cancel active hanging orders. See example below.

The hanging orders was not cancelled and was only refreshed when `max_order_age` triggered.

### Example when max order age is important

Suppose you are participating in the `HARD-USDT` campaign with an order refresh time of 30 minutes. Max order age refreshes depending on what you set it on as long as it is lower than the order refresh time. When participating in liquidity mining outstanding orders that reach the 30-minute mark are not subjected to rewards. It is best to use the parameter to refresh the age of the orders to still be eligible for rewards.
