title: Order Override
description: Info on order override
---

This feature allows users to customize and specify how Hummingbot creates orders in terms of order levels, spread, and size.

## `order_override`

The user provides orders to override the orders placed by the `order_amount` and `order_level` parameters directly.

** Prompt: **

No prompt

## How It Works

Since this is a feature designed for advanced users, it is not configurable from the Hummingbot client. Instead, follow the steps below to set up the `order_override` parameter:

1. Edit the strategy config file located in the Hummingbot `conf` folder using a text editor. <br/>See [Where are my config and log files?](https://hummingbot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005206343-Where-is-my-config-and-log-file-) in the FAQ page for more information.
2. The input should be in a dictionary format, and the key is user-defined.<br/>Make sure there is a space between the colon ( : ) and open bracket ( [ ) as shown in the [Sample Configuration](#sample-configuration) then save your changes.
3. For the changes to take effect, perform any of the following:
   - Run `stop` command, `import` the config file again, and then `start`
   - Run `exit` command and restart Hummingbot

While `order_override` is in effect, it supersedes existing values of `bid_spread`, `ask_spread`, `order_amount` and `order_levels`.

## Sample Configuration

```json
order_override:
    order_1: [sell, 2.5, 5]
    order_2: [sell, 1.5, 10]
    order_3: [buy, 0.5, 1]
    order_4: [buy, 0.8, 3]
```

Using the sample input above for `order_override`, Hummingbot creates the following orders:

```
Orders:
   Level  Type  Price Spread Amount (Orig)  Amount (Adj)       Age
       2  sell 384.59  2.50%          0.1              5  00:00:01
       1  sell 380.83  1.50%          0.1             10  00:00:01
       1   buy 373.33  0.50%          0.1              1  00:00:01
       2   buy 371.45  0.80%          0.1              3  00:00:01
```
