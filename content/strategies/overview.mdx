The current release of Hummingbot comes with six strategies:

### Pure Market Making

Post buy and sell offers for an instrument on a single exchange, automatically adjust prices while actively managing inventory.

### Cross Exchange Market Making

Also referred to as _liquidity mirroring_ or _exchange remarketing_. In this strategy, Hummingbot makes markets (creates buy and sell orders) on smaller or less liquid exchanges and does the opposite, back-to-back transaction for any filled trades on a more liquid exchange.

### Binance Perpetual Market Making

Similar to pure market making but with more risks in terms of leverage up to x75.

### Arbitrage

Aims to capture price differentials between two different exchanges (buy low on one, sell high on the other).

The [Hummingbot whitepaper](https://www.hummingbot.io/hummingbot.pdf) provides more details about these strategies, as well as additional ones that we are working on for future versions of Hummingbot.

### Celo Arbitrage

The celo-arb strategy is a special case of the normal arbitrage strategy that arbitrages between the automated market maker (AMM) exchange on the Celo blockchain and other markets supported by Hummingbot. This strategy allows users to earn arbitrage profits while contributing to the stability of the Celo cUSD price peg.

For more information, please see this [blog post](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-06-celo-arbitrage/).

### AMM Arbitrage 

AMM-arb lets you exploit the differences between AMMs like [Balancer](/protocol-connectors/balancer/) and order book exchanges like Binance. Extending the celo-arb strategy released a few months ago, amm-arb uses a new, simpler design that works with any AMM protocol, on both Ethereum and non-Ethereum chain. You can take a look on our supported [Protocol Connectors](/protocol-connectors/overview/) for this strategy

### Liquidity Mining Strategy (BETA)

Released on [version 0.36.0](/release-notes/0.36.0/)
Liquidity mining strategy is still in **BETA**. This is designed so users can run a single strategy and earn rewards on multiple markets but different pairs without the same base or qoute are not available at the same time. Reduced the number of parameters needed and has dynamic spread adjustment on market volatility.
