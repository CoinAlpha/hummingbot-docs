## How it Works

Similar to pure market making strategy, Hummingbot continually posts limit bid and ask offers on a market and waits for other market participants ("takers") to fill their orders.
In addition to that, position management features are introduced to let users further configure the bot to make managing positions easier and remove the need to manually interact with the derivative exchange through other available platforms to close position. Two(2) position management features are currently available which are the `Trailing_stop` and `Take_profit` features. Each feature has different parameters which the bot uses to logically determine when positions would be closed when using that particular feature. In all, both features(Trailing stop and take profit) have capability of securing profits. It should also be noted that only the trailing stop feature can stop-loss immediately loss is detected even when trailing hasnâ€™t begun. Unlike trailing stop, take profit feature places a limit order at a profitable price from position entry price which is determined by the spreads for each take profit sides.

## How to start

We aim to teach new users the basics of Perpetual market making, while enabling experienced users to exercise more control over how their bots behave. By default, when you run `create` we ask you to enter the basic parameters needed for a Perpetual bot.

> **Note**: Paper trading is supported, enter `[perpetual_connector_name]_testnet` when prompted for derivative name.

1. In Hummingbot, enter `create`.
2. Enter `[perpetual_connector_name]_testnet` or `[perpetual_connector_name]`.
3. Enter the trading pair, for example `BTC-USDT`.
4. Follow on-screen prompts and info for Perpetual parameters.
5. Enter `start` to run the strategy.

For details on each Perpetual parameters, see the following sections for details. These parameters are fields in Hummingbot configuration files (located in the `/conf` folder, e.g. `conf/perpetual_market_making_[#].yml`).

### `position_mode`

Generally, two(2) position modes are available when using a perpetual connector : 
1. `One-way mode` : In this mode, only one active position(long or short) per trading pair is possible. Trying to open a second position would result in increasing or decreasing the size of the position depending of the side of the second position. 
2. `Hedge mode`: Unlike one-way mode, it is possible to have a long and short position open concurrently without affecting the size of one another.
