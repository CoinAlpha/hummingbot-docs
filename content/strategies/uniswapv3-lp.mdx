Before you can use the Uniswap v3 LP Strategy in Hummingbot, you need to install and configure the [Gateway API server](/gateway/installation).

The flowchart below is a guide on how to set up the installation and configuration of the strategy.

### Setup Ethereum wallet and nodes

Ensure you have setup the Ethereum wallet and nodes, for more details:

- see [Setup Ethereum Wallet](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/connect-exchange/#setup-ethereum-wallet)
- see [Setup Infura Node](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/connect-exchange/#option-1-infura). Take note of the Ethereum RPC URL to be use later for Gateway Docker settings.

### Setup Gateway

You need to setup the [Gateway](/gateway/installation) to use this strategy.

## Uniswap v3 LP Strategy Iteration 1 Behaviour

The bot will create two liquidity positions:

### Buy-Side

- The upper price bound of this position is as close as possible to the current market price
- The lower price bound of this position is set by the spread defined by the user (A)
- The amount of tokens locked on this position is the amount defined on the quote amount question (D)

### Sell-Side

- The lower price bound of this position is as close as possible to the current market price
- The upper price bound of this position is set by the spread defined by the user (B)
- The amount of tokens locked on this position is the amount defined on the base amount question (C)
