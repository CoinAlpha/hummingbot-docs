## Timestamp for this request is outside of the recvWindow

```
binance.exceptions.BinanceAPIException: APIError(code=-1021): Timestamp for this request is outside of the recvWindow.
```

Timestamp errors in logs happen when the Binance clock gets de-synced from time to time as they can drift apart for several reasons. Hummingbot should safely recover from this and continue running normally.

## Too much request weight used; IP banned

### Sample log error message

```
binance.exceptions.BinanceAPIException: APIError(code=-1003): Way too much request weight used; IP banned until 1573987680818. Please use the WebSocket for live updates to avoid bans
```

This error occurs when the Binance API rate limit is reached. Causes include:

- Using multiple order mode with 3+ orders per side
- High order refresh rate
- Running multiple instances of Hummingbot
- Weight/Request error in logs happens when it encounters a warning or error and Hummingbot repeatedly sends the request (fetching status updates, placing/canceling orders, etc.) which resulted in getting banned. This should be lifted after a couple of hours or up to a maximum of 24 hours.
