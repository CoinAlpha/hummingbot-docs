### Binary: Why does my anti-virus software flag Hummingbot's binary installer?

This has been reported by some users starting from version 0.33 (see [GitHub issue #2680](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2680)).

The two AV engines that give a positive reading are Gridinsoft and Cyren. They both have methods of submitting false positives:

https://blog.gridinsoft.com/how-to-report-the-false-detection/ https://www.cyren.com/support/reporting-av-misclassifications

We believe these are fairly generic designations that are probably triggered by the general crypto code in the `ethsnarks` module for the Loopring connector.

### Source: ModuleNotFoundError

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hummingbot.market.market_base'
root - ERROR - No module named
‘hummingbot.strategy.pure_market_making.inventory_skew_single_size_sizing_delegate’
(See log file for stack trace dump)
```

Solution 1: exit Hummingbot to compile and restart using these commands:

```
conda activate hummingbot
./compile
bin/hummingbot.py
```

Solution 2: make sure you have a conda section in ~/.bashrc. Run conda init if it is not there. Explanation: if you have custom PATH defined in ~/.bashrc, supplied scripts (./compile etc) may pick the wrong python binary, causing different errors.

### Source: SyntaxError invalid SyntaxError

```
File "bin/hummingbot.py", line 40
  def detect_available_port(starting_port: int) -> int:
                                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

---

### Source: conda command not found

```
$ conda
-bash: conda: command not found
```

If you have just installed conda, close terminal and reopen a new terminal to update the command line's program registry.

If you use `zshrc` or another shell other than `bash`, see install dependencies (https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/mac/#install-from-source)

### Docker: Package 'docker.io' has no installation candidate

![Hummingbot installed](/img/package-docker-io.png)

Install Docker using get.docker.com script as an alternative. Install curl tool then download and run get.docker.com script.

```
apt-get install curl
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

```

Allow docker commands without requiring sudo prefix (optional).

```
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

---

### Docker: Permission denied after Docker installation

```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at
unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post
http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.39/containers/create?name=hummingbot_instance:
dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
```

Exit from your virtual machine and restart.
